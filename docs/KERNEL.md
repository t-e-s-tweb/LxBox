# The core — sing-box-lx (fork)

Everything about the L×Box VPN core: where we get it, how it is pinned, which
build tags it carries, and the gotchas of a version bump. ARCHITECTURE.md links
here.

## What it is

The core is our fork [`Leadaxe/sing-box-lx`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx)
(the working and release branch is `lx`; `lx-1.14` is an archived anchor for the
finished migration to 1.14; for the upstream base see “The current pin” below):
upstream sing-box plus AmneziaWG 2.0, native XHTTP, VLESS encryption (the PQ
layer) and LxBox-specific features (idle-suspend, the round-robin balancer, DNS
groups, the DNS stream and more).

Control goes through the **libbox CommandClient** (§122; the Clash HTTP server
was removed).

Tailscale calls in use (tasks 579 and 581; upstream API, no fork delta; names from
`javap` over `classes.jar` of `v1.14.2-lx.8`): `subscribeTailscaleStatus(TailscaleStatusHandler)`
→ `TailscaleStatusSubscription` (own client, one sink `lxbox/cc/tailscale`),
`setTailscaleExitNode(tag, stableID)`, `tailscaleLogout(tag)`,
`startTailscalePing(tag, peerIP, TailscalePingHandler)` → `TailscalePingSession`
(own client, sink `lxbox/cc/tailscale_ping`). `TailscalePeer.getKeyExpiry()` and
`getLastSeen()` are Unix seconds; `TailscalePingResult.getLatencyMs()` is a double in
milliseconds. `startTailscaleSSHSession` is not used.

## Where the AAR comes from

| | |
|---|---|
| Version pin | `app/android/libbox.version` — the single source of truth (local and CI) |
| Download | `scripts/fetch-libbox.sh` → `libbox.aar` from the fork's GitHub Releases plus a SHA256 check; idempotent (the `.libbox.version` marker) |
| Called from | `scripts/build-local-apk.sh` and CI (`ci.yml` → the android job → “Fetch sing-box-lx core”) |
| The AAR in git | NO (~110 MB as of lx.25; `app/android/app/libs/` is in `.gitignore`); `build.gradle.kts` → `implementation(files("libs/libbox.aar"))` |

**The current pin: `v1.14.2-lx.11`** (see `app/android/libbox.version`) — lx.1
plus XHTTP HTTP-version parity (**SPEC 104**, lx.2), Vision on top of VLESS
Encryption (**SPEC 105**, lx.3), the runtime WG/AWG endpoint toggle
(**SPEC 106**, lx.4: `CommandClient.setEndpointEnabled`, `endpointState =
"disabled"`, bound since §557), a working `sing-box schema` (lx.5) and the XHTTP
default without `xmux` moved to `max_connections 3` (lx.6), three MASQUE hangs fixed
(**SPEC 108**, lx.7), the sync with sing-box `stable` (lx.8), the Tailscale
control channel on port 443 from the first connection (**SPEC 111**, lx.9),
the headroom Tailscale needs on a direct UDP path restored in the AWG
wireguard-go (**SPEC 112**, lx.10) and one more `stable` sync (lx.11). The Java
surface of lx.11 is identical to lx.8 (`javap` over both `classes.jar`). The `lx.1` layers: **SPEC 097**, **SPEC 098**,
**SPEC 101** and the upstream sync to sing-box **1.14.2** (**SPEC 102**).

**SPEC 098** moves every global knob of the fork into a root **`lx`** block,
grouped by subsystem. The three idle keys keep their SPEC 020 semantics and
their values; only their place in the config changed:

| Old key | New key |
|---|---|
| `route.lx_idle_suspend` | `lx.wg.idle_suspend` |
| `route.lx_idle_suspend_reachable` | `lx.wg.idle_suspend_reachable` |
| `route.lx_idle_teardown` | `lx.wg.idle_teardown` |

The old names are accepted for **one release** with a WARN per key
(`route.lx_idle_suspend is deprecated, use lx.wg.idle_suspend`). The same key in
both places with the **same** value warns too; with **different** values the core
does not start (`route.lx_idle_suspend conflicts with lx.wg.idle_suspend`).
LxBox emits only the new names since §535 — writing both would mean a WARN on
every start. `GetRunningConfig` (SPEC 037) returns the canonical form, so a
config that arrived with the old keys shows up as `lx.wg.*`.
`lx.naive` is reserved for SPEC 096 and is rejected like any unknown key until
then.

**SPEC 097** adds lazy build and a build budget for WG/AWG endpoints:
`lx.wg.lazy_build` (bool — endpoints start torn down, the device is built on the
first dial; requires `idle_suspend`), `lx.wg.build_max` (int, `0` = no cap) and
`lx.wg.build_overflow` (`wait` \| `build`). **LxBox writes `lazy_build: true`
and `build_max` together with `idle_suspend`** (§536, settings since §542:
`wg_lazy_build`, default `true`, and `wg_build_max`, default `5`, VPN Settings →
System → WireGuard connections; `0` is written as `0`, which the core reads as
no cap). With lazy build switched off neither key is written: the core would
accept `build_max` alone, but the UI greys the limit out with the toggle, so a
greyed-out value must not act. An empty idle threshold means no `lx` block at
all, so none of them are written either. `build_overflow` stays unwritten — the core default `wait`
is what we want. The same layer exposes the state
of each endpoint through `GetOutbounds`: `endpointState`
(`never_built` / `building` / `up` / `asleep` / `torn_down` / `down`) and
`idleSinceSeconds`. "Not built" is a state, not an error — §535 shows it as
*Node not built yet* / *Node asleep* rather than a timeout.

**SPEC 101** stops the AWG log being drowned in
`failed to send handshake initiation: disabled UDP GSO` (LxBox #95): the message
belongs to a normal path and no longer reports as an error. Connectivity was
never affected, only log readability.

**SPEC 102** is the upstream sync to sing-box `v1.14.2`. The part that shows on
the device: the network state is reset only on a **real** interface change, not
on every system notification (`route/network.go` rewritten), so a Wi-Fi ↔ mobile
switch costs the tunnel far less. Also hysteria2 realm and a `resolved` D-Bus
service.

`lx.masque.idle_timeout` is a new global default for masque outbounds without
their own `idle_timeout`; a node's own key wins, including an explicit `"0"`.
MASQUE idle stays **off** by default, and LxBox does not write the global key;
a WARP MASQUE node carries `idle_timeout` only when the wizard's field is filled
(empty = the key is omitted = never suspended).

Every `lx.wg` key acts **only** in builds with `with_lx_idle_suspend` (the mobile
AAR) — see gotcha 1.

The Java surface is **additive**: 253 classes in both versions with identical
name lists, 3494 → 3498 signature lines, and the whole diff is four accessors on
`io.nekohasekai.libbox.OutboundGroupItem` (`getEndpointState`/`setEndpointState`,
`getIdleSinceSeconds`/`setIdleSinceSeconds`). Nothing removed, nothing changed.
**LxBox depends on this pin for §535**: the config emits `lx.wg.*`, which an
older core rejects as an unknown key — and an unknown key takes the *whole*
config down, so rolling the core back below `v1.14.2-lx.1` means reverting the
emit to `route.lx_idle_*` first.

Below, the layers this pin contains:

**SPEC 095** is an upstream sync: sing-box `v1.14.1` plus 34 commits of `stable`,
zero drift at the cut. The part that shows on the device is the initial handshake
of a WireGuard/AWG peer given by a domain name — it now completes on the first
attempt. Before, the first attempt was lost, the core logged `handshake did not
complete after 5 seconds, retrying`, and switching to such a node cost 5.4–5.7 s.
The fix needs the wireguard-go fork re-based onto v0.0.7, and the sing-tun fork
moves to the upstream pin with it; all fork patches (AWG, batch paths, the
`acceptLoop` self-heal) are carried over. Also in this layer: HTTP/2 error types
from `sing` now go through the upstream `baderror.WrapH2` mapping in the v2ray
HTTP and gRPC-lite transports, so our own wrappers for those two are gone (XHTTP
keeps its own handling), plus upstream fixes for DNS timeouts under query
deduplication, temporary IPv6 address rotation, half-close through connection
wrappers, a read-loop spin on persistent errors, a crash on a corrupted cache
file and the OOM report on clean shutdown; `sing-mux` goes to v0.3.8.

**SPEC 099** stops Node diagnostics from killing the app on a `naive` node. With
the tunnel up, the diagnostics probe read the remote address of the connection
inside the tunnel; a Cronet connection has no address, so dereferencing that nil
took the whole core down — the process died at once, regardless of the memory
limit. Traffic through the node and `urltest` were never affected. Now the probe
returns status, body and elapsed time as for any other node, and `remoteAddr`
stays empty for `naive` — that is the expected value, not an error.

`option/` is untouched in both layers (`git diff v1.14.1-lx.9 v1.14.1-lx.10 --
option/` is empty), so the config schema, the wire formats, Clash API, gRPC/lxd
and the AAR tag sets are unchanged; Go 1.26.8. The Java surface gains exactly one
additive method from upstream — `Libbox.hasTunInbound(String)` (javap over all
253 classes of `classes.jar`: same class list, 3493 → 3494 signature lines, that
one line the whole diff). Nothing is removed or changed, so no app-side change is
needed to consume this core, and LxBox does not call the new method.
**LxBox depends on this pin for §526**: Diagnostics on a `naive` node is safe to
run. Rolling the core back below lx.10 brings back the crash and the lost five
seconds on domain-addressed WG/AWG peers.

**`v1.14.1-lx.9`** — lx.8 plus
one layer. **SPEC 094** (lx.9) stops the XMUX breaker from counting our own
teardown as a server failure. When LxBox switches a node, or the core retires an
xhttp session, it closes the http2/h1 response body itself; the read side of the
xhttp connection then surfaces that as `context.Canceled` or `net.ErrClosed`.
Until lx.9 the breaker treated those two as evidence the server had broken the
stream: it logged `ERROR connection download closed: http2: response body closed`
once per request and marked the XMUX session failing, so a perfectly healthy
node was evicted and rebuilt. lx.9 recognises a local cancellation at the
xhttp-conn boundary and neither logs nor counts it; a real remote break is still
reported exactly as before. Wire format, config schema, AAR tag sets and
submodules unchanged, Go 1.26.8, and the Java surface is identical to lx.8
(javap over all 253 classes of `classes.jar`, 3493 signature lines — diff empty).
**LxBox depends on this pin for §522**: the log of a working xhttp/REALITY node is
clean, and switching servers no longer costs an XMUX rebuild. Rolling the core
back below lx.9 brings the false `response body closed` errors back — they are
cosmetic plus one wasted session teardown, not a loss of connectivity. Upstream
issue: LxBox #148.

**`v1.14.1-lx.8`** — lx.7 plus
one layer. **SPEC 093** (lx.8) teaches the gRPC transport the Xray notation where
`service_name` starts with a `/` and is therefore a ready-made request path, not a
name: the core escapes such a value segment by segment, treats the last segment as
the stream name and drops a `|…` tail, so `/a/b/Tun` goes on the wire as
`/a/b/Tun`. Without a leading `/` nothing changes — the value is one escaped
segment and the core appends `/Tun` itself (`a/b` → `/a%2Fb/Tun`). Wire format
otherwise, config schema, AAR tag sets, Go toolchain and submodules unchanged; the
Java surface is identical to lx.7 (javap over all 253 classes of `classes.jar`,
3493 signature lines — diff empty).
**LxBox depends on this pin for §468**: the value of `transport.grpc.service_name`
reaches the core verbatim on both the URI and the JSON path, with no normalisation
of our own. This holds **only for lx.8 and newer** — rolling the core back below
lx.8 means restoring the §464 translation of the single-segment form
`/<service>/Tun` → `<service>`, because an older core escapes the whole value as
one segment and such a node answers 404.

**`v1.14.1-lx.7`** — lx.5 plus
two more layers; lx.6 was never pinned on its own, it is contained in lx.7.
**SPEC 091** (lx.6) tightens two validators. `tuic.udp_relay_mode` used to accept
any string at all: a typo such as `"fast"` went through silently and the node then
behaved as if the field had not been set. The core now answers
`unknown udp_relay_mode: fast (expected native or quic)` and fails the config.
The same commit validates the masque `uri` field, whose only allowed value is
`standard`. **SPEC 092** (lx.7) names the entry in initialization errors: where
the core used to say `initialize outbound[0]: invalid short_id` it now says
`initialize outbound[0] vless[proxy-de-1]: invalid short_id`, i.e. the type and
the tag next to the index. Six places carry it — DNS server, endpoint, inbound,
service, outbound and certificate provider. The errors raised *inside* the
constructors were left alone, and the libbox API surface did not move either.
This one came from a user request filed against LxBox on 18.09: the app shows the
core's error text verbatim, and a bare index into an internal config array tells
nobody with a fifty-node subscription which node broke. The wire format, the
config schema, the AAR tag sets, the Go toolchain and the submodules are all
unchanged; the Java surface is identical to lx.5 (javap over all 253 classes of
`classes.jar` — diff empty).
LxBox's own guard for `tuic.udp_relay_mode` (§459, contract §24.2 item 7.8) stays
in place: it rejects the garbage in the node form, before the core is ever
started, and reports it where the user can fix it.

**`v1.14.1-lx.5`** — a single
hotfix on top of lx.4. **SPEC 090**: a REALITY `short_id` longer than 16 hex
characters is now rejected with `invalid short_id` before decoding, on the client
(`common/tls/reality_client.go`) and on the server (`reality_server.go`) alike.
Until lx.5 the same input panicked with `index out of range`: `hex.Decode` wrote
into an `[8]byte` array without checking the input length first, so a node from a
subscription with an over-long `short_id` took the process down instead of
failing the config. Found by the contract's DRIFT inventory (TASKS_LXBOX §24.4 г)
and handed to the core agent on 18.09. The wire format, the config schema, the
AAR tag sets, the Go toolchain and the submodules are all unchanged, and the
libbox API did not move: the Java surface is identical to lx.4 (javap over all
253 classes of `classes.jar` — diff empty).
LxBox's own guard from §343 (drop a `short_id` over 16 hex characters instead of
trimming it) stays where it is — it is UX protection at the edge, and with lx.5
the core behind it answers with an error rather than a panic.

**`v1.14.1-lx.4`** — two
REALITY changes on top of lx.3. **SPEC 088**: `tls.fragment` and
`tls.record_fragment` now apply to REALITY too. Until lx.4 the REALITY client
built its handshake on the bare socket and silently skipped both, including the
automatic `record_fragment` the core turns on under a `detour` — so the global
fragmentation toggle looked enabled and did nothing on exactly the nodes that
need it most. Nothing changed on the app side: the `applyTlsFragment` post-step
(`post_steps/tls_transforms.dart`) never excluded REALITY nodes, so the toggle
simply started taking effect on them. **SPEC 089**: a per-node
`tls.reality.key_share` — `hybrid` demands the `X25519MLKEM768` key share,
`classical` strips it out of `key_share` and `supported_groups`, absent means
whatever the fingerprint carries. The wire format, the AAR tag sets and the Go
toolchain are unchanged; the Java surface is identical to lx.3 (javap over all
253 classes of `classes.jar` — diff empty).
**LxBox depends on this pin for §457**: the app emits `tls.reality.key_share`
without a core-version gate (LxBox has one core, pinned here). Rolling the core
back below lx.4 means the core rejects `key_share` as an unknown field and takes
the whole config down — the emit would have to be closed again, exactly like
§451's fingerprint set below.

**`v1.14.1-lx.3`** — the
base moves to sing-box `v1.14.1`, and a **fourth fork submodule** appears:
`submodules/utls` = `Leadaxe/utls-lx` (`metacubex/utls` v1.8.7 plus three
cherry-picks from `refraction-networking/utls`). It carries the `HelloFirefox_148`
and `HelloSafari_26_3` presets, which send the hybrid `X25519MLKEM768` key share
before X25519 — the thing an XTLS/REALITY server on Xray ≥ v26.9.8 demands.
Until now only the Chrome presets carried it, so nodes with `fp=firefox` (and
`fp=safari`) were silently forwarded to the camouflage site. On the fork's stand
against Xray v26.9.9 both now pass with 204; Xray v26.7.x and `fp=chrome` show no
regression (core SPEC 086 for firefox, lx.2; SPEC 087 for safari, lx.3). lx.3 also
stops a VLESS `encryption` handshake from hanging forever against a node that
accepts the connection and then goes silent (core SPEC 050 §2). Configuration,
the wire format and the tag sets are unchanged; the Java surface is identical to
lx.39 (javap diff of `PlatformInterface`, `CommandClient`, `Libbox` — empty).
**LxBox depends on this pin for §451**: `firefox` and `safari` no longer raise
`reality_fp_not_chrome` (`kRealityHybridFingerprints`), which holds only on lx.3
and newer — rolling the core back means narrowing that set again.

**`v1.14.0-lx.39`** —
lx.38 plus the SPEC 085 hotfix: UDP through a SOCKS5 proxy whose UDP ASSOCIATE
reply carries `BND.ADDR` `0.0.0.0`/`::` was dialed at the local system, so UDP
died silently while TCP worked; the relay address is now replaced by the proxy
server address, as Xray does (report of 2026-09-14). The Java surface is
identical to lx.38 (full `javap` diff of `io.nekohasekai.libbox.*` — empty).
Since lx.38 the AAR carries **`with_tailscale`** plus the eleven `ts_omit_*` trims
(§435, contract ## 13, owner decision 2026-09-14): the `tailscale` endpoint
and the `tailscale` DNS server type are compiled in. Measured on the fork side
(M1 Pro, go1.26.6, NDK r28c): the AAR build time did not grow (the Tailscale
code was already compiled through `tailssh` under `with_gvisor`; the tag adds
only `tsnet` and the sing-box glue) and the AAR grew by 2.58 MB (116.8 →
119.4 MB; arm64 `libbox.so` +1.96 MB). lx.38 also merges the SPEC 084 hotfix
(an ABBA deadlock of nested selectors, fork issue #20). The Java surface is
unchanged from lx.36 (javap-diff of `PlatformInterface`, `CommandClient`,
`CommandClientHandler`, `BoxService`, `Libbox` — identical). The upstream
base is lx.37's: `upstream/stable` b7eb49bb8 (v1.14.0 + 33), submodules
wireguard-go v0.0.6 / sing-tun v0.9.3. LxBox gates a Tailscale node on this
version through the build-tag mirror (`with_tailscale` in `kCoreBuildTags`,
`core_chain_capability.dart`; the registry node gate, contract §56): on an older core the node is skipped at
build with `tailscale_core_unsupported`.

**`v1.14.0-lx.36`** — two hotfixes on the same upstream base as lx.34 (sing-box
1.14.0 + 16 post-release commits); nothing in the configuration or on the wire
changes.

- **lx.36 — REALITY against Xray-core ≥ v26.9.8 (core SPEC 083).** The REALITY
  server now requires the post-quantum `X25519MLKEM768` key share in the
  ClientHello, placed before the optional `X25519`, and silently forwards
  anything else to the camouflage site — the core logged
  `reality verification failed` on every such node. The core used to strip
  that key share itself (a leftover from uTLS 1.7.2); it no longer does, and
  the authentication key follows the server's choice (`Ecdhe`, else
  `MlkemEcdhe`). Servers before v26.9.8 are unaffected (verified against
  v26.7.11 and v26.7.28). Only the `chrome` fingerprint family carries the
  key share; LxBox warns on a REALITY node with any other explicit fingerprint
  and suggests `chrome`, but the node's fingerprint goes into the config as is
  (§444; 2.23.2 substituted `chrome` at build time).
- **lx.35 — 100 % CPU until restart with XHTTP behind a CDN that resets
  streams (core SPEC 082, fork issue #14).** The stream-reset error left the
  transport conn with the HTTP/2 library's own error type; any HTTP/2 client
  running *through* that outbound (DoH with `detour`, rule-set
  `download_detour`, a chained outbound) mistook it for its own stream error
  and spun in its read loop. The type no longer leaves XHTTP, HTTP and
  gRPC-lite conns; log text and configs are unchanged.

Java surface: unchanged from lx.34 (both are Go-only fixes under
`common/tls` and the transports).

Device-verified on the `LxBox_test` AVD against a local Xray v26.9.9
(`dest = www.apple.com`): with lx.34 both test nodes failed with
`reality verification failed`; with lx.36 both carry Vision traffic, and a
node imported with `fp=firefox` reaches the core as `chrome`.

**`v1.14.0-lx.34` — the upstream 1.14.0 stable base**: the fork rebases from the mid-August 1.14
beta line onto released sing-box 1.14.0 plus 16 post-release commits. Nothing
in the configuration or on the wire changes; the fork's own layer (AmneziaWG,
XHTTP, MASQUE, DNS groups, chains, sniffers, lxd, the command protocol) is
untouched. What LxBox sees:

- A **URL test can no longer hang** on a node that accepts the connection and
  never answers — every probe runs under its own 15 s deadline in a separate
  goroutine, so one stuck node no longer blocks the whole run.
- A **manual URL test now always tests every node** of a group (upstream moved
  `URLTest` to `force` semantics), regardless of how fresh the history is; the
  periodic ticker keeps the lazy, pool-bounded check. Nested urltest/selector
  groups are probed recursively instead of contributing only their current node.
- **DNS**: resolver-discovery queries (`_dns.resolver.arpa` and any `_dns.*`
  SVCB) are answered with an empty NOERROR instead of being forwarded, so a
  browser cannot learn an upstream DoH endpoint and go around the tunnel;
  inverted DNS rules whose address filters come from a rule set match again
  (broken since 1.12.22); fakeip UDP replies map back to the right address.
- **Network**: interface-change callbacks run in the background with the
  previous update cancelled, so a Wi-Fi ↔ cellular switch no longer blocks the
  monitor; the double interface bind of UDP sockets under auto-detect is gone.
- **System stack** (sing-tun on the upstream tip): TCP NAT keeps a separate
  port table per address family, no panic on a TCP packet of an unconfigured
  family, and the gVisor stack drops its excessive TCP keepalive traffic.
- **QUIC**: congestion control no longer reports "application limited" after an
  idle period, so long-lived TUIC and naive connections keep their throughput.

Java surface: **additive only** (javap over 253 classes, `lx.33` → `lx.34`) —
`InterfaceUpdateListener.updateNetworkPath(String)`,
`Libbox.promotePowerReportDraft()`, and on `SetupOptions` the pairs
`appVersion` / `appMarketingVersion` / `powerReportEnabled`. LxBox binds none of
it: `InterfaceUpdateListener` is only *consumed* here (`DefaultNetworkMonitor`
holds one the core hands over), never implemented, so the new abstract method
does not touch the build.

**`v1.14.0-lx.33` — AmneziaWG 3.0/3.1 (§421)**: the `wireguard` endpoint accepts
the AWG 3.x root keys — `header_protection_key`, `content_padding_addition`, the
ranged timings `rekey_after_time` / `rekey_timeout` / `reject_after_time` /
`keepalive_timeout` / `max_handshake_attempts` (a number or an `"N-M"` string),
`random_trailers`, `disable_cookies`, plus a ranged
`persistent_keepalive_interval` on a peer. `lx.32` was the first core with the
fields; `lx.33` fixes receiving data packets under `random_trailers`. A core up
to `lx.31` rejects a config with any of these keys as a whole, which is why the
pin and the parser moved in one commit. Field reference:
`sing-box-lx/docs-lx/lx-protocols-transports.ru.md` §2.1, §2.7, §2.9, §2.10.

**`v1.14.0-lx.30` — SPEC 076/059 plus the XHTTP detour DNS fix**: DNS servers of type `udp`,
`tcp` and `tls` now work behind a `detour` through an XHTTP node. Every such
query used to die with `write request: context canceled`, which read as red
URL tests for `masque` and `wireguard` nodes probed by a *domain* URL (the same
node by IP URL was green) and as a dead system DNS over TUN while the tunnel
itself was alive. DoH through the same node kept working, because it has its
own HTTP client and no pool. Cause: the DNS transport pool cancels its dial
context right after `dial` returns — the standard `net.Dialer` contract — while
the XHTTP dial handed the connection up *before* the stream was raised and kept
watching that context. `auto` with REALITY resolves to `stream-one`, so a
default configuration was affected. `DialContext` for `stream-one`/`stream-up`
now returns only once the HTTP layer has accepted the request body.

Also in this window: the XHTTP xmux circuit breaker (a CDN resetting upload
streams used to pin the CPU at 100% until a core restart — 3 consecutive stream
failures now retire the connection, with a 100 ms→3 s backoff before a new
transport), `packet-up` uploads surviving a graceful `GOAWAY`, and a `stream-up`
pool leak. Before that, lx.28 brought MASQUE `vhttp: auto` **as the default**
(behind a TCP-only hop the tunnel self-rescues into h2 instead of hanging to the
dial deadline), per-position runtime chain toggles, and the XHTTP
`session_table` / `session_length` session-id form.

**This bump IS API-neutral for everything LxBox calls.** A `javap` sweep over
both release AARs (252 → 253 classes) shows **zero removals and zero signature
changes** — the diff is purely additive and confined to the kernel's own chain
RPC, which the client does not bind: `ChainPosition.getDisabled/setDisabled`,
a new `ChainToggleResult` class (`getWarmupError`), and two `CommandClient`
methods, `setChainPositionEnabled(String, int, boolean)` and
`getChainCloneConfig(String, int)`. `PlatformInterface` is untouched, so no new
no-throw stubs are needed. `kUtlsFingerprints`
(`app/lib/services/parser/utls_fingerprint.dart`) still mirrors the core's
`uTLSClientHelloID` switch one-for-one — re-checked against the tag, no change.

⚠️ The MASQUE legacy names (`network`, flat `sni` / `skip_cert_verify` /
`fragment*`) were announced for removal *in* `v1.14.0-lx.30` but are still
accepted there, with a deprecation warning. Irrelevant to us either way: per
§393 the client emits only the new set.

Client-side follow-ups this bump makes possible but does not deliver: the chain
toggle RPC has no binding (the app's chain/detour UI is config-level), and
`vhttp: auto` becoming the core default means an empty `vhttp` now means `auto`
rather than `h3`.

The previous pin was `v1.14.0-lx.28-rc.1`; `v1.14.0-lx.27-rc.4` before it —
**SPEC 072**, the detour freeze finished off: a failed XHTTP stream raise now
tears the upload pipe from the reading half (`fail()`), and requests of all
three modes ride a conn-scoped context instead of the dial context, so the
15-second dial deadline no longer kills a *live* stream. The field dump this
fixes was taken on lx.27-rc.2 — 38 minutes of freeze, all traffic dead
including direct, cured only by force-stop. SPEC 070/071 are absorbed into 072
as one owner; their mechanisms are unchanged under the old markers.

`rc.3` was skipped on purpose: `1.14.0-lx.27-rc.3-dev` had already shipped in
field test builds of the mac launcher, so the release took the next number to
keep field binaries from colliding with the tag.

**The lx.27-rc.4 bump was API-neutral.** A `javap` sweep over all **245** classes of both
AARs was byte-identical — 3363 lines, zero differences — so no wrapper or
call-site changes. (Beware the stale `classes.jar` that `libs/` keeps next to
the AAR: it can lag several cores behind and diffing against it invents
removals that are not there. Extract `classes.jar` from the actual release AAR
for both sides.)

⚠️ **The previous pin `v1.14.0-lx.27-rc.2` was NOT API-neutral**, unlike every
lx.2x bump before it.
`PlatformInterface` gained a new abstract method:

```java
public abstract void cancelNotification(java.lang.String, int) throws java.lang.Exception;
```

An unimplemented abstract method is a **compile error**, not a silent
degradation — so the wrapper must grow a default. Ours did:
`PlatformInterfaceWrapper.cancelNotification` is a no-op default (a probe
session posts no notifications), `BoxVpnService` forwards to
`BoxService.cancelNotification`, and that one calls `nm.cancel(typeID)` — the
same id `sendNotification` passes to `nm.notify`. The `identifier` argument is
the channel id; on Android it takes no part in addressing.

Everything else in the diff is **purely additive** — 17 new Taildrop classes
from upstream beta.15, `Libbox.TaildropChunkSize`, `NetworkInterface.gateway`,
and new fields on the status structs. A `javap` sweep over the 228 pre-existing
classes shows **zero removals**, so no existing call-site changes.

Earlier in this line: a Windows-only WireGuard bind fix (SPEC 069, lx.27-rc.1;
a v6 bind failure no longer kills the live v4 socket), and before it the final
name of the `masque` key (`vhttp`) plus the urltest group's mode in the API
(lx.25-rc.5). The client side of that is §393.

**`transport` → `vhttp` (SPEC 062).** The name from rc.4 was removed **with no
alias**: for vless/trojan/vmess `transport` is the V2Ray transport key, and it is
an object (`{"type":"ws"}`), not a string. One name with two meanings and two
types is exactly the confusion SPEC 062 removes. The interim name lived through a
single prerelease; the client does not support it at all (it never went out — see
§393).

`network` remains deprecated until `v1.14.0-lx.30`, as announced in rc.4.

**`Group.mode` (SPEC 019)** — the mode of a urltest group: `least_test` (an
ordinary urltest, with the node in `selected`) | `round_robin` (balancing, with
the state in `GetPool`) | empty (not a urltest). Promised “in any build”, unlike
`GetPool`, which sits behind the `with_lx_command` tag.

⚠️ **The Android AAR still does NOT have this field, re-checked on
`v1.14.0-lx.30`** (`javap io.nekohasekai.libbox.OutboundGroup` — no `getMode()`;
originally observed up to and including lx.27-rc.2). `javap io.nekohasekai.libbox.OutboundGroup` shows no `getMode()`
in either build. Through lx.27-rc.1 the whole Java surface diffed clean against
lx.25-rc.5 (`javap` over all 228 classes — identical; `classes.jar` itself
hashes differently, `23b2eb27…` → `c9cc31f7…`, so compare the API, not the
jar); rc.2 adds the surface listed above but still not `getMode()`. The native
part *is* built from the pinned tag (`strings libbox.so` → the pinned version, and the
`least_test` / `round_robin` strings are present) — so the Go code is there, but
the gomobile binding for `OutboundGroup` has not been regenerated. This does not
affect §393 (`vhttp` is config parsing, not a Java surface), but anyone who wants
`mode` has to wait for a core build that regenerates the binding.

**The `masque` schema (introduced in rc.4).** The HTTP version moved from
`network` to `vhttp`, and the TLS options moved from the flat root into a nested
`tls{}` (`sni` → `tls.server_name`, `skip_cert_verify` → `tls.insecure`, and
`fragment` / `record_fragment` / `fragment_fallback_delay` under `tls`). The
remaining fields (`server`, `server_port`, `profile`, `private_key`,
`public_key`, `ip`, `ipv6`, `uri`, `mtu`, `idle_timeout`, `keep_alive_period`,
`network_list`) are unchanged. The old names are accepted until
**`v1.14.0-lx.30`**, and every such outbound prints one warning to the log.

⚠️ The same field given under both the old and the new name **with different
values** is fatal at startup (the error names both fields). Identical values are
not treated as a conflict. Hence the client rule in §393: emit only the new set of
names, never both at once; legacy lives strictly on the input side (the URI parser
and the JSON import).

The new field `tls.disable_sni` produces a ClientHello with no SNI. An empty `sni`
did NOT do that — it was replaced by the profile's default.

The core now **warns** (it used to stay silent) about fields unsupported for
masque: `tls.alpn`, `tls.ech`, `tls.reality`, `tls.kernel_*`, and about
fragmentation when `vhttp: h3`.

**The default SNI changed:** `consumer-masque.cloudflareclient.com` →
`www.cloudflare.com`. This affects configs with NO explicit SNI; an explicit value
still wins. The reason (core measurements on two independent Russian networks):
with the previous name the h3 tunnel to the endpoint does not come up. The name is
not critical for authentication — the endpoint is verified by pinning its ECDSA
key.

⚠️ This diverges from `assets/warp_endpoints.json`, where `recommended_sni` is
`consumer-masque.cloudflareclient.com` (commit 9d5629ba) — exactly the name the
core found non-working on h3. Revisiting that recommendation was split out of
§393.

Diagnostics: `masque: CONNECT-IP timed out` instead of a wall of
`http3: parsing frame failed` when the endpoint accepted QUIC but never answered
CONNECT-IP. The original cause is preserved in the error chain.

The previous pin — **`v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.4`** — carried the same config schema under
the name `transport` (removed in rc.5) plus the default SNI change. Its Java
surface equals rc.3.

Before that — **`v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.3`** — two changes on top of rc.1, both about
the TLS leg under `detour`.

**SPEC 060: `record_fragment` turns itself on when an outbound dials through a
`detour`.** The symptom: a chain like `MASQUE detour VLESS` hung for about 15
seconds and died with `tls handshake: EOF`, from which the cause cannot be
reconstructed. The cause is neither the core nor the SNI: the lower leg forwards
our ClientHello under its own name, and if the PMTU beyond that leg is smaller
than the ClientHello, the packet is lost silently — the ICMP “fragmentation
needed” never reaches the client. The threshold is purely about size (1488 B gets
through, 1502 B vanishes) and belongs to the path beyond the leg rather than to
the protocol: on other nodes the same bytes pass straight through. It reproduces
with bare `curl`, without sing-box. The mechanism already existed in the core
(`fragment` / `record_fragment`) — what was missing was the default. There is a
single injection point, `NewClientWithOptions`, before the engine is chosen, so
STD, uTLS and REALITY all get the same default.

⚠️ The default changes the behaviour of **any** outbound with a `detour`, not just
MASQUE chains. An explicit user choice always wins; `fragment: true` is not
upgraded by adding a record split. The cost is bounded by the handshake — only the
first TLS record is rewritten, and an established stream is untouched. The direct
path (with no `detour`) is unaffected.

**SPEC 021: MASQUE h2 moved onto the shared `common/tls`.** It used to be the only
outbound bypassing the shared layer: on h2 it drove TLS through a bare
`crypto/tls.Client` for the sake of pinning the endpoint's ECDSA key — and in
exchange it received nothing from the shared layer (including the new SPEC 060
default). Now h2 goes through the shared client and the pinning sits on top of it.
h3 is untouched: QUIC does not carry TLS over TCP.

The Java surface **did not change** — `classes.jar` is byte-identical to rc.1 (the
same SHA256), no `javap` diff is required and no client changes are needed.

⚠️ This is an **rc**: build the device run around detour configs in general rather
than around a single chain, and separately verify that an explicit
`fragment: true` is not upgraded. The tail of rc.1 (below) is also still open.

Before that — **`v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.1`** — **SPEC 058: `GetURLViaOutbound`**, a
diagnostic HTTP GET through a node addressed by tag, returning the response BODY.
It closes the class of questions `URLTestOutbound` cannot answer: not “is the node
alive” but “what can be seen through it” (the exit IP, geo, `warp=`). The active
selector does not switch, so live connections stay intact. The consumer is §392
(the Diagnostics tab on the node screen).

The Java surface **did change**: `+GetURLResult`, `+HTTPHeaders`,
`CommandClient.getURLViaOutbound(String,String,int,int,HTTPHeaders)`.
⚠️ GOTCHA: the getters on `GetURLResult` carry **no `get` prefix** — `content()`,
`status()`, `truncated()`, `contentType()`, `remoteAddr()`, `elapsedMs()` (unlike
`URLTestOutboundResult.getDelay()`): gomobile strips the prefix when the Go field
name does not start with `Get`. The binding calls exactly those short forms.

The call contract (details in kernel SPEC 058): GET only; `maxBytes` 0 → 256 KiB
with a 1 MiB ceiling, and truncation is flagged as `Truncated`; **a non-2xx is a
result, not an error** (403 and 429 arrive with a body); `RemoteAddr` is the
address from inside the tunnel, NOT the node's exit IP (the body carries that);
`ElapsedMs` is not written into the urltest history. A probe is real traffic and
wakes sleeping WG, so it happens only on an explicit user action — background
sweeps over the list are forbidden on the client side.

⚠️ This is an **rc**: the field check from a device (`cdn-cgi/trace` through a WG
endpoint and through a vless outbound; HTTPS without custom roots) is not closed
in the core's criteria.

Before that — **`v1.14.0-lx.24-rc.2`** (v2.20.7) — catching up with upstream and a
toolchain change, with no changes to the lx-layer code. The branch sits on top of
`upstream/testing` again (base `v1.14.0-beta.9`): out of 19 new upstream commits
the notable ones are that the local transport's DNS caches are partitioned by
interface signature (a network change no longer serves someone else's cache); the
WireGuard handshake resolves **every** address of a domain peer and races them
(`SetEndpointResolver`); hijacked DNS gained process info; plus fixes to reset
network, FakeIP async-save, the Android process finder, unbounded allocations on a
malicious SRS and the OOM stub. The build toolchain is go1.26.5, following
upstream (the SPEC 044 principle). The fork's submodules were rebased before the
core: sing-tun (with SPEC 040 on top) and wireguard-go (AWG2 plus SPEC 041 on top;
`SendHandshakeInitiation` = AWG padding/junk plus the upstream fan-out). The Java
surface did not change — `classes.jar` is byte-identical to lx.22 (the same
SHA256), so no `javap` diff is needed.

The intermediate `lx.23` and `lx.24-rc.1` are about the `lxd` daemon (desktop,
SPEC 056/057): they do not affect the Android build, which is why the pin jumps
from lx.22 straight to lx.24-rc.2.

⚠️ This is an **rc, not a stable**: the core's release notes require a device run
(tunnel, DNS, URL test, WG/AWG — several times) before lx.24 is promoted to
stable, because of the submodule rebase (runbook §1.4) and the toolchain change
(SPEC 044, the hy2/quic profile).

Before that — **`v1.14.0-lx.22`** (v2.20.6) — two changes. **SPEC 054**:
`least_test` reacts to failures of real dials — a penalty for a “the path is
dead” class of failure (a dial timeout, `EHOSTUNREACH` / `ENETUNREACH` /
`ETIMEDOUT`), one fallback dial through the best candidate (capped at two
attempts), and moving the group's selection on a successful fallback without
tearing down live connections. `ECONNREFUSED` / `ECONNRESET` and
`context.Canceled` carry no penalty. At three penalties on the leader an emergency
mode kicks in: ranking first by penalties, then by latency; a penalty is only
lifted by proof of life, and nothing resets on a timer; if everything is
penalised, probes are forced no more than once every two minutes and probe
skipping via `passive_check` is disabled for that period. There are no new timers
— deltas come from a timestamp, so it survives sleep and freezing. This is a
direct continuation of SPEC 052: that one produced a fast failure signal, but
nothing consumed it. **SPEC 053**: REALITY declares `minClientVer` 26.3.27 — Xray
since v26.7.11 requires a minimum client version by default and silently serves
the camouflage site instead of refusing when it does not match. The Java surface
did not change — 226 classes, a 0-line `javap` diff.

Before that — **`v1.14.0-lx.21`** (v2.20.5) — SPEC 052: a 15-second connect
deadline on netstack dials (the WG/AWG endpoint and the per-connection dials of
MASQUE, openvpn, openconnect and tailscale that share it). Until then this was the
only class of dial paths with no timeout: `C.TCPConnectTimeout` lives only in the
system `net.Dialer`, netstack paths bypass it structurally, and the only boundary
was gVisor's SYN backoff — 6 retransmits, about 127 s to an error, times N
addresses for a domain. The Java surface did not change. The pins before that were
`v1.14.0-lx.20` (promoting the branch to stable, with no code changes relative to
rc.8) and `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.8` (v2.20.4).

On rc.8 — a technical release on top of rc.7 that changes no behaviour. It removed
two merge traps: twice in a row (235 commits, and 217 in rc.7) the same two files
broke in the same way, and the breakage is invisible when reviewing the merge. The
cause was not that upstream deleted something — it simply does not have that code;
what broke was the **shape** of our additions: both sat where both sides append,
and the merge glued them into something nobody wrote, without a conflict. The cure
is structural rather than a patch: the idle-suspend interfaces were moved into
their own file together with their import (the source file became byte-identical
to upstream, so there is nothing left to glue there), and the check when releasing
a sleeping endpoint was collapsed into a single call instead of a block next to
upstream's closing line (our difference inside the function is now one line, so a
future upstream change will collide with it loudly rather than swallow it
silently). The tree was checked for additions of the same shape — there are no
others.

The substance arrived in **`v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.7`** — the fork's base was moved onto
upstream `v1.14.0-beta.8`, 217 commits were carried over, and every dependency was
set to exactly the revision upstream expects. Of note for the client: a TUN
dispatcher deadlock, more stable URLTest results, a Tailscale state observer (the
upstream variant was taken — it does not block and survives a broken notification
bus, which ours did not), and updated gvisor/QUIC. The fork's features are all
present: the detour chain, the DNS query stream, the URLTest pool, idle-suspend,
AWG obfuscation and all eight extended client commands. The merge itself
introduced two defects, both caught before release: an upstream line under our
check in the path that releases a sleeping endpoint (a use-after-free — caught by
the idle-suspend regression test, not by the build) and a lost import of the sleep
interface (caught by the build).

⚠️ The order when bumping dependencies: **dependencies first, then the merge.** The
reverse order is what broke the rc.5 build (see below).

The Java surface did not change between rc.6 and rc.7: 226 classes in both, a
`javap` diff of **0 lines of difference**, and no client changes required.

Along the way the pin passed through **`rc.6`** (a fix for the startup crash
introduced by rc.5: the WireGuard component there had fallen 14 commits behind and
only 3 were taken — the ones the compiler complained about; among the remaining 11
were race fixes and a lock rework, i.e. a combination upstream never had. In rc.6
the component was taken whole and our changes laid on top), **`rc.5`** (two months
of upstream, 235 commits; OpenVPN/OpenConnect as connection types — no field
experience, SPEC 051), **`rc.4`** (SPEC 050: node checks got stuck forever against
a silent server and survived stopping the VPN, holding the entire node list — 2806
nodes from an already-unloaded subscription; the group waits for every check before
publishing, hence the empty ping column and the memory growth until the app was
shot) and **`rc.3`** (SPEC 047 — a crash on a network change while the tunnel was
starting: “reset network” was let through as soon as the core object existed, while
the tunnel was not yet assembled; SPEC 048 — a whole-process crash on a connection
to a dead node, where state was freed before the formal close and a late packet
landed in freed memory; SPEC 049 — the Go toolchain version is recorded in
`go.version`, and `go.mod` is no good for that: it holds the language floor 1.24,
on which every QUIC protocol fails).

The pin before those — **`v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.2`** (v2.19.3) — **SPEC 046**: hijacked
DNS queries moved off the tun stack's packet loop. Resolution used to happen right
in the loop, and calling the resolver blocks the caller for the duration of the
lookup — so a DNS server with a `detour` onto a black-hole node held the loop for
the entire DNS timeout, and NOTHING went through the tunnel (other DNS, ICMP, new
connections of any protocol). A background trickle of queries was enough to keep
the tunnel frozen almost continuously. Exchanges now happen outside the loop, with
a ceiling of 256 concurrent ones (beyond that they are dropped and the client
retries — normal for UDP). The bug is older than this release and lived in both tun
stacks. The Java surface did not change (a `javap` diff rc.1↔rc.2 of 0 lines) and
no client changes were needed.

On top of that came what had already arrived in **`v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.1`**: there
were no Go code changes on top of lx.19 there, only the build toolchain — all
twelve of the fork's build jobs are pinned to Go 1.25.x (upstream parity, SPEC
044), while the Android AAR moves **down** from 1.26.x to that same 1.25.x. The
defect threshold for vendor kernels is “>= 1.25”, and both versions (1.25.5 and
1.26.5) are device-verified, so this is a change within a verified range. `go.mod`
is untouched (it says `go 1.24.7`, which is a language floor rather than a
toolchain choice).

The pin before those — **`v1.14.0-lx.19-rc.3`** (v2.19.2) — three fixes on top of
lx.18: SPEC 041 v2 (the event-driven nudge `RebindStaleEndpoints`, consumed by
§340), SPEC 044 (an AAR built with Go 1.24 killed ALL quic-go outbounds on vendor
kernels — hysteria2/tuic/masque-h3; the fix is the Go 1.25 toolchain, §341) and
SPEC 045 (a nil panic on trojan/vless with `tls.enabled:false` during a URL test).

The pin before that — **`v1.14.0-lx.18`** (v2.19.1, §335) — VLESS `encryption`
(SPEC 032, feature VLESS_ENCRYPTION): the post-quantum layer
`mlkem768x25519plus` **inside** VLESS (it works instead of TLS — such nodes arrive
with `security=none`; not to be confused with REALITY). The field did not exist in
the core's schema before, so nodes carrying it were silently dead: the transport
came up (WS `101`, gRPC SETTINGS) and then the server tore the connection down
without a single line in the log. The client half is §335: the builder moves the
field from `vless://` links (the query) and Xray JSON (`users[0].encryption`) into
a flat field of the outbound next to `uuid`, emits it only when it is non-empty and
not `none`, and writes it back in `toUriVless` (otherwise it would be lost on a
round trip through §302 rules). Measured on a device: 12 genuine nodes came back to
life (ws 7/8, grpc 5/5), taking the subscription from 42 to 53 out of 76. The
libbox Java surface is unchanged — this is a config field, not an API. ⚠️ The flip
side is gotcha 2: a core older than lx.18 rejects a config with `encryption`
**entirely**, so bumping the pin and enabling the emit are one atomic step.

Along the way the pin passed through the stable **`v1.14.0-lx.17`** — the promotion
of the rc.1–rc.5 line plus XHTTP fixes that never shipped in an rc: SPEC 042 (the
`application/grpc` Content-Type on streaming requests — parity with Xray) and SPEC
043 (the root of the complaint “the subscription's XHTTP nodes are dead” —
`stream-one` sent a path without a trailing slash, the server returned 404 and the
connection hung until the timeout; `auto`+REALITY goes into `stream-one`, hence the
false trail “auto is broken”). Device-verified: the subscription's XHTTP nodes came
back. Both fixes are inside the core, with no client changes.

**The previous pin: `v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.5`** (v2.19.0) — two self-healing fixes on
top of rc.3 (rc.4, below) plus the 01.08 upstream sync in rc.5: naiveproxy v150, a
DNS rule race (a completed rule was blocked by one armed earlier), the WireGuard
system device not configuring the interface's DNS, a TLS fragment on Windows
without TCP estats, and a routing loop on darwin. None of them required client
changes.

**rc.4 / SPEC 041** (feature HOTFIXES) — WG/AWG endpoints heal themselves after
the device sleeps, instead of an eternal ERR until a manual reconnect. While the
phone sleeps the tunnel's UDP 5-tuple dies along the path (the NAT mapping expires
and/or the DPI flow record goes stale), and upstream wireguard-go retries the
handshake into that same dead socket forever — the same source port, the same dead
5-tuple. A reconnect “fixed” it purely by opening a new socket with a fresh
ephemeral port. Now the core does that: when a peer's handshake retry cycle is
exhausted (about 90 s of unanswered initiations — an existing give-up event that
only fires under demand for traffic), the bind is reopened once with a fresh port
and a new handshake starts immediately. For masquerade profiles the `i1` decoy
leaves with the first initiation of the new 5-tuple, reopening the flow on the DPI.
The debounce is one rebind per give-up cycle; an explicitly pinned `listen_port` is
preserved (self-healing by changing the port is then unavailable, by design); and
both bind schemes (direct and through a `detour`) are healed by the same mechanism.
In a healthy state, while asleep and after closing it costs nothing — no timers, no
goroutines, no traffic: on a sleeping device the rebind degenerates into a no-op and
does not conflict with idle-suspend (SPEC 020).

**rc.4 / SPEC 040** (feature HOTFIXES) — the system TCP stack no longer dies
permanently when its listener is killed out from under the core. With
`stack: "system"` every new TCP connection from the TUN is NAT-rewritten onto a
local forwarder listener. Its accept loop treated **any** `Accept` error as
terminal and exited silently — so when something else in the shared Android process
closed that listener's fd (a stray close on a reused descriptor number — the very
§047 failure of “the browser is dead, QUIC is alive”), the stack kept running and
kept rewriting every new SYN onto a dead port. The OS answered with an instant RST:
any application got `ECONNREFUSED` in about 16 ms until the VPN was restarted, while
UDP/QUIC/DNS stayed alive. Reproduction on a device: roughly once per 8–36 fast VPN
restarts, worse on a “dirty” process — which is why it went uncaught for months.
sing-tun is now a fork submodule (`submodules/sing-tun`, pinned to the exact
upstream revision from go.mod) with a single-file patch: an unexpected `Accept`
error is logged with its errno (which names the culprit), the listener is recreated
on the same address, the forwarder port is republished atomically, and the loop
keeps serving. A deliberate `System.Close()` still stays silent. The recovery
counter doubles as telemetry: if it ticks, the client-side trigger closing the fd is
still alive. Device-verified on 01.08.2026 (§329): two live occurrences, **errno =
`EINVAL`**.

**rc.2:** rotation of the report archive (SPEC 039 / feature HOTFIXES) — the
`files/oom_reports` and `files/crash_reports` directories were never cleaned, and
**575 directories / 427 MB accumulated over 19 days** on the device; now, before
writing a new report, the archive is trimmed to **32 directories and 64 MB**
(whichever hits first), deleting by mtime rather than by name (the collision
suffixes `-1`…`-1000` break lexicographic order). Plus **240 upstream commits**:
notable for the fork is that URLTest now *requires* history storage in the context
instead of silently creating it. **rc.3:** `Endpoint.Close()` returns the tun
device's close error again (the nil guard from SPEC 020 swallowed it and reported a
clean shutdown); the nil check stayed, only the error propagation changed. **The
javap diff rc.1 → rc.3: NO changes** — `PlatformInterface`, `CommandClient`,
`BoxService` and `Libbox` are identical, and the class set matches (226 in both
AARs). Device-verified on 30.07.2026 (CPH2411): a clean start, an empty
`last_start_error`, 0 errors or fatals in the logs, 54 live measurements.

Take care when bumping through rc.2: it carries 240 upstream commits, so a javap
diff is mandatory even when the release notes promise a “one-line fix” — and it has
to be checked against **your** pin, not against the previous rc. Both rc.4 fixes
live entirely inside the core (the wireguard-go bind and the sing-tun accept loop)
and do not touch the Java surface, so no client changes were needed.

**The previous pin: `v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.1`** — SPEC 038: `GetRunningConfig` returns a
`RunningConfig` object with a `content()` getter instead of a bare `String`. The
bare string **killed the core process on android/arm64 on every call**: gomobile
encodes a Go string as `nstring{void*, len}`, cgo puts it into a `__packed__`
frame, that loses 8-byte alignment, and assigning a slot holding a pointer goes
through `runtime.wbMove` → `bulkBarrierPreWrite` → `throw: unaligned arguments`.
That is not a panic but a fatal throw — the tunnel died with no chance. The defect
was introduced by SPEC 037 (GetRunningConfig; earlier notes called it “SPEC 036”,
a number later freed in the core and now meaning something else), so §311 was
inoperable both in rc.3 and in the stable `lx.16`; that is exactly how the core died
on 26.07 (found through the §316 channel). **The javap diff lx.16 → lx.17-rc.1:**
the only change is that `getRunningConfig()` returns `RunningConfig` instead of
`String`; `PlatformInterface`, `CommandClientHandler` and `Libbox` are unchanged.
The client change is that `BoxCommandClient.getRunningConfig()` calls `.content()`.
Device-verified on 27.07.2026 (CPH2411): 6 consecutive calls with a live tunnel →
200, the core alive, no new crashes.

**The previous pin: `v1.14.0-lx.16`** (stable) — SPEC 037:
`CommandClient.GetRunningConfig`, a canonical snapshot of the RUNNING core's config
(captured once at start in `newInstance`, post-override, re-marshalled; a copy of
the string is returned). The client half is §311 in LxBox (`activeModel`,
`GET /config/running`): it closes the “a rebuild while the tunnel is live” window
and the false “Not found” on a visible node. The javap diff against lx.15:
`+ String getRunningConfig() throws` on `CommandClient`; `PlatformInterface` and
`CommandClientHandler` UNCHANGED. RPC errors: not-STARTED → `FailedPrecondition`,
an attached path or a capture failure → `Unavailable`, and without
`with_lx_command` → `Unimplemented` — the binding swallows all of them into null.

`lx.15` (the one before) — SPEC 002: XHTTP no longer breaks behind a reverse proxy.
VLESS+XHTTP through nginx or a CDN with `mode: packet-up`, a trailing-slash `path`
(`/upload/`) and `session_placement: header` used to fail with
`unexpected download status: 301 Moved Permanently` (the client unconditionally
stripped the trailing slash for ALL modes; nginx `location /upload/ {}` answered
with a 301 redirect to the bare path, and the download request — raw HTTP/2 with no
redirect following — surfaced that as a dial error). The fix: `path` is preserved
as-is, and the trailing slash is stripped only on the bare-path stream-one request.
Default configs (a session id in the path) were never affected. Covered by a
url_test case. Plus a merge of upstream `testing` (13 commits: the async DNS
refactor, a WG detour fix that converges with SPEC 029, OpenConnect
auth-challenge and other fixes). Upstream base `v1.14.0-alpha.48`. AAR build tags
unchanged. **Device-verified** on CPH2411 (2026-07-21): a crash-free start, the
Debug API answering, the VPN coming up. The version history is at the end of this
file.

`lx.14` — SPEC 030: stopping the tunnel no longer hangs for 10+ seconds with many
WG/AWG endpoints (the teardown in `box.Close()` waited for an in-flight ping wake;
the fix is closing the endpoints concurrently while interrupting the wake, with no
teardown step skipped). The core half of §287.

### The AAR before a core release

While the fork has not yet cut an official release (work on an rc chain), the AAR
comes from the artifact of the fork's CI run, NOT from Releases:

```bash
gh run download <run-id> --repo Leadaxe/sing-box-lx --name dist-android
```

The downloaded `libbox.aar` is placed into `app/android/app/libs/` by hand (with
the `.libbox.version` marker set to the right rc, otherwise `fetch-libbox.sh` will
re-download it). This is how §215 (rc.18) and the pre-release rc.21/rc.22 for
v2.9.0 were prepared (MASQUE symbols were verified with `strings libbox.so`).

- ⚠ Do **NOT** commit `app/android/libbox.version` before the core is released — a
  pin on a tag that does not exist in Releases breaks the fetch for everyone else
  and in CI.
- ⚠ In production, use **only the official release AAR** (see gotcha 3).

## AAR build tags

They are baked in `cmd/internal/build_libbox/main.go` (`sharedTags`), NOT in the
client:

```
with_gvisor, with_quic, with_wireguard, with_utls, with_naive_outbound,
badlinkname, tfogo_checklinkname0,
with_xhttp, with_awg, with_lx_command, with_lx_idle_suspend, with_lx_chain,
with_openvpn, with_openconnect,
with_tailscale, ts_omit_logtail, ts_omit_ssh, ts_omit_drive, ts_omit_taildrop,
ts_omit_webclient, ts_omit_doctor, ts_omit_capture, ts_omit_kube, ts_omit_aws,
ts_omit_synology, ts_omit_bird
```

`with_tailscale` joined the AAR in **lx.38** (§435, contract ## 13; the
`ts_omit_*` tags only trim what `with_tailscale` pulls in — the upstream
mobile set). Before lx.38 the AAR was built without it on purpose (APK size);
LxBox's build gate keeps a Tailscale node out of the config on such a core.

libbox does not export its build tags (`Libbox.version()` is the version
string only), so LxBox mirrors this list in `kCoreBuildTags`
(`app/lib/services/builder/core_chain_capability.dart`) for the registry's node
gate (`build_tag` + `on_core_unsupported`, contract 1.1.60). A core bump must
re-check the list and move `kCoreBuildTagsPin`; `node_core_gate_test` fails
until the pin matches `app/android/libbox.version`.

`with_clash_api` is deliberately absent (§122 — CommandClient instead of Clash
HTTP), and so is `with_usbip` (server-side). `with_openvpn` / `with_openconnect`
are **in** since the SPEC 051 upstream merge (owner's decision 2026-08-05): each
tag gates one package holding client and server behind the same tag, and the
server half is accepted as the price of the client — see the `lx:begin openvpn`
comment in `build_libbox`.

## ⚠️ Gotchas when bumping the version

### 1. `with_lx_idle_suspend` (rc.19+) — idle-suspend behind a build tag

The idle-suspend tick machinery (`lx.wg.idle_suspend`, SPEC 020 / §128; the key
lived at `route.lx_idle_suspend` until the `v1.14.2-lx.1` pin — SPEC 098, §535)
is compiled **only** with the `with_lx_idle_suspend` tag. **Without it, any
`lx.wg.*` key in a config KILLS the core's startup**
(`lx.wg.* is set but this build lacks idle-suspend support; rebuild with -tags
with_lx_idle_suspend (mobile-only feature)`). That covers every key of the block,
including an explicit `idle_teardown: "0"`, `lazy_build`, a non-zero `build_max`
and `build_overflow: "build"`.

- The mobile **AAR** carries the tag (`build_libbox` sharedTags), so the official
  release AAR is fine.
- The desktop/CLI `sing-box` (for `sing-box check`) does NOT have the tag by
  default. Validating a config containing `lx.wg.idle_suspend` through the
  desktop binary will fail without an explicit `-tags with_lx_idle_suspend`
  (`sing-box check` validates the keys, but the router does not start, so the
  desktop binary accepts them at check time).

### 2. A new transport or route field → “unknown field” kills the WHOLE config

The core decodes configs strictly: if the client emits a field an older core does
not know, the **entire** config fails to load, not just the one node. The classic
“the parser outran the core” desync:
- §214: rc.15 did not know `sc_max_each_post_bytes` (XHTTP SPEC 002 v2) → bumped to rc.16.
- Diagnosis: `/device` core_version (§213) — the real core version inside the APK.

**§460 — sync the contract along with the pin.** The set of allowed body fields now lives in the
contract registry (`registry/protocols/*.json` → `body`, plus `tls`/`transports`/`multiplex`/
`dialer`), and the registry is refilled from the new core's `option/*.go` **at pin time**, not
when some garbage shows up (contract §24.1.3). So a bump is two steps: the launcher side adds the
new fields to the registry, then `bash app/tool/sync_contract.sh` pulls the copy and the bundled
mirror `app/assets/contract/` across. Skip it and the build-time sanitiser strips the new core's
fields as `unknown_key` — the node still works, but quietly without them. `min_core` in the
registry is what keeps a field off an older core, so it is worth checking that a newly described
field carries it.

### 3. A gomobile AAR is not byte-reproducible

The sha of a local build ≠ the sha of the release AAR (paths and timestamps inside
the archive). They are functionally identical. `fetch-libbox.sh` verifies the sha
of what it downloaded against the release `SHA256SUMS` — which is why production
**always** uses the official release AAR rather than a local one.

### 4. `Libbox.version()` is not visible through `strings`

A gomobile binary does not expose the version string. Verify the core version only
through `/device` core_version on the device, not by pulling strings out of the
AAR.

### 5. The order inside `redirectStderr` — §334 depends on it

`experimental/libbox/log.go:69-77`: `Setup` first archives
`CrashReport-<source>.log` into `crash_reports/`, and only then does `os.Create`
truncate the file for the new session.

§334 (`CrashRecovery`) stands on that order: the “the previous run crashed”
detection reads a non-empty report BEFORE `Libbox.setup()`, and the truncation
inside `setup` serves as the “one crash, one cleanup” dedup. If a bump moves the
archiving after `os.Create`, the §316 banner will start losing crashes; if the
truncation disappears, the cache will be reset on every launch after a single
crash.

To check on a bump: `archiveCrashReport` is called before `os.Create`, and the
early return on `len(content) == 0` (`log.go:29`) is still inside it — that is the
same “non-empty means there was a crash” criterion our detection uses.

### 6. The VLESS `encryption` method name is baked into a registry rule

§477 (contract 1.1.9) checks the **shape** of `vless.encryption` against
`^mlkem768x25519plus(\.[^.]+){3,}$`, and the method name is the only thing in it
judged by content. A node whose value does not match is dropped, so a core that
learns a **new** method without the registry learning it too would have its good
nodes rejected.

To check on a bump: compare the method name with
`protocol/vless/lx_encryption.go` (`parseClientEncryption`). A new method or a
new appearance in the core means the rule has to move first — it lives on the
launcher side (`registry/protocols/vless.json`), so the bump needs a contract
sync, not a local edit.

The rest of the grammar (appearance, RTT, padding blocks, key lengths and
coefficients) is deliberately **not** mirrored here: a copy would drift at the
first bump and start rejecting working nodes. Anything finer than the shape is
caught by the core itself.

## Client versus core: which side to fix a config bug on

Sometimes a “this node kills the config” bug is fixed from both sides
(defence in depth):
- **the client** — do not emit anything invalid, and show the user a ⚠️
  (visibility). Example: §217 (XHTTP `uplink_http_method=GET` outside packet-up →
  reset plus `XhttpParamResetWarning`).
- **the core** — a soft fallback instead of a fatal. Example: rc.20 `c0bbb1c5` —
  the same GET→POST fallback plus a WARN, so that one malformed node does not take
  the whole config down.

Both layers earn their keep: the client provides visibility (a ⚠️ in the
subscription), the core provides insurance in case the client misses something.

## Version history (the LxBox-relevant parts)

| rc | What was added |
|---|---|
| **v1.14.2-lx.8** (current pin) | **Sync with sing-box `stable` (15 commits past v1.14.2) and three MASQUE hangs fixed.** lx.8: idle connections of outbounds and DNS servers that no rule, endpoint, group selection or detour refers to any more are closed (a `round_robin` `urltest` counts its whole pool as in use; XHTTP `xmux` pools and WG/AWG idle-suspend unchanged), and on Android pausing the device closes idle connections too; WireGuard, AmneziaWG and `masque` now really set the outer UDP socket free to fragment on Linux and Android (the kernel kept DF, so an oversized outer datagram of a tunnel inside a tunnel was dropped), while Hysteria, Hysteria2 and TUIC no longer allow fragmentation by default (upstream); upstream TUN/DNS fixes, and the nested-`selector` lock fix the fork carried since `v1.14.0-lx.38` is now upstream's. lx.7 (fork SPEC 108): `vhttp: auto` drops a remembered h2 that stopped coming up and tries h3 within the same dial; closing an h2 tunnel no longer waits behind a stalled write; an h3 endpoint that never answers CONNECT-IP no longer holds the dial. Config schema unchanged, build tags unchanged (`build_libbox/main.go` identical to lx.6). Java surface: 254 classes in both, 3512 → 3519 javap lines — added `CommandServer.recordLockState/recordScreenState/wakeNow`, `Libbox.discardPowerReportDraft/goroutineDump/triggerGoHang`, `SetupOptions.get/setPlatformMetadata`; removed `Libbox.promotePowerReportDraft`, which LxBox never called. AAR sha256 `91364b7b4f57468937096c20cf4c0217d331cada66a1e05fdbf4a16acf3fdacd` (checked against the release `SHA256SUMS`). |
| **v1.14.2-lx.6** | **XHTTP no longer opens a connection per stream by default** (fork #32). With no `xmux` section, or an empty one, the core now selects `max_connections 3` (all streams share at most three connections) instead of `max_concurrency 1` (a fresh TLS connection per stream, dozens to hundreds of parallel connections to one IP on a phone, the pattern reported to be cut on Russian mobile networks). `h_max_request_times 600-900` and `h_max_reusable_secs 1800-3000` unchanged; the values follow Xray-core `18e2839` (XTLS/Xray-core#6376). An `xmux` section with at least one field set is still taken as written. Contains lx.5 (fork #30): `sing-box schema` no longer aborts on `option.AWGRange` and emits the full schema with the fork's keys; the command is unused by the AAR, config parsing and runtime untouched. Config schema unchanged; Java surface identical to lx.4 (javap diff over all 254 classes, 3512 lines — empty). AAR sha256 `7cd4c20c34b46b8a4515816e85037a11df8704faa2a2e3681792d874d2255ae9` (checked against the release `SHA256SUMS`). |
| **v1.14.2-lx.4** | **WG/AWG endpoint on/off at runtime** (§557). Fork SPEC 106 — `CommandClient.setEndpointEnabled(tag, enabled)` → `EndpointToggleResult.getState()`: a disabled endpoint puts its device down the way idle sleep does, drops its connections and rejects every dial with `WireGuard endpoint is disabled`; nothing wakes it until it is enabled again. `GetOutbounds` reports the new `endpointState = "disabled"`. gRPC errors: `NotFound`, `InvalidArgument` (not WG/AWG), `FailedPrecondition` (not started, closing), `Unavailable` (wake-up failed). Not persisted: a reload or apply starts every endpoint enabled, so LxBox re-applies its set of disabled tags after each core start within a VPN session and drops it when the VPN stops. The release also carries an OpenWrt installer the AAR does not use. Config schema unchanged, the contract does not move; Java surface additive — 253 → 254 classes, 3498 → 3512 javap lines, the whole diff being the `EndpointToggleResult` class (`getState`/`setState`) and `CommandClient.setEndpointEnabled(String, boolean)`. AAR sha256 `ddd266242ed236f028faa17942937475221931dda50a06fce031c6136e67fb10` (checked against the release `SHA256SUMS`). |
| **v1.14.2-lx.3** | **Vision on top of VLESS Encryption, XHTTP picks the HTTP version from `tls.alpn`** (§544). Fork SPEC 105 (fork #29) — a VLESS node with both `flow: xtls-rprx-vision` and `encryption` (`mlkem768x25519plus…`) failed on every dial with `vision: not a valid supported TLS connection: *encryption.CommonConn`; Vision now runs on the encryption layer the way Xray does, on any transport, XHTTP included. LxBox keeps `flow` on such nodes since §544 (contract 1.1.55, `relation.unless_set`). Contains lx.2, fork SPEC 104 — XHTTP chooses HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 from `tls.alpn` like Xray: `["h3"]` → HTTP/3 over QUIC through the same `detour`, `["http/1.1"]` and cleartext → HTTP/1.1 (cleartext was h2c), REALITY → always HTTP/2 (an `alpn` without `h2` is replaced with a warning), otherwise HTTP/2 as before; no new keys, so an `alpn` that was silently ignored on an XHTTP node now changes its HTTP version. lx.2 also carries the Windows `lxd` service (SPEC 103), which the AAR does not use. Config schema unchanged; Java surface identical to lx.1 (javap over all 253 classes: 2932 signature lines in both, empty diff). AAR sha256 `42474da0956c429b020e12d439b4ae60670b59a6e21d474a87afe633d7ac979c` (checked against the release `SHA256SUMS`). |
| **v1.14.2-lx.1** | **The root `lx` block, lazy WG build, a quieter AWG log and the upstream 1.14.2 sync** (§535). Fork SPEC 098 — every global knob of the fork moves into a root `lx` block: the three SPEC 020 idle keys become `lx.wg.idle_suspend` / `_reachable` / `_teardown`, keeping their semantics; `route.lx_idle_*` is accepted for one release with a WARN per key, and the same key in both places with different values is a start error. `lx.naive` is reserved for SPEC 096. Fork SPEC 097 — `lx.wg.lazy_build`, `lx.wg.build_max` and `lx.wg.build_overflow` (LxBox writes none by default), plus `endpointState` / `idleSinceSeconds` per WG/AWG endpoint in `GetOutbounds`. Fork SPEC 101 — `disabled UDP GSO` is no longer logged as an error on AWG nodes (LxBox #95). Fork SPEC 102 — upstream sing-box `v1.14.2`: the network state is reset only on a real interface change (`route/network.go` rewritten), so a Wi-Fi ↔ mobile switch no longer churns the tunnel; hysteria2 realm; `resolved` D-Bus. New config keys, so the contract moves with the pin; Java surface additive — 253 classes in both, 3494 → 3498 signature lines, the whole diff being four accessors on `OutboundGroupItem` (`EndpointState`, `IdleSinceSeconds`). |
| **v1.14.1-lx.10** | **Upstream sync to v1.14.1 + 34 commits, and Node diagnostics no longer crashes the app on a NaiveProxy node** (§526). Fork SPEC 095 — the initial handshake of a WireGuard/AWG peer given by a domain name completes on the first attempt (before: the attempt was lost, `handshake did not complete after 5 seconds, retrying` in the log, 5.4–5.7 s to switch to such a node); the wireguard-go fork is re-based onto v0.0.7 and the sing-tun fork onto the upstream pin, all fork patches carried over. HTTP/2 error types now go through the upstream `baderror.WrapH2` mapping in the v2ray HTTP and gRPC-lite transports (our wrappers for those two removed, XHTTP keeps its own), plus upstream fixes for DNS timeouts under query deduplication, temporary IPv6 rotation, half-close through connection wrappers, a read-loop spin, a corrupted cache file and the OOM report on clean shutdown; `sing-mux` v0.3.8. Fork SPEC 099 — with the tunnel up, diagnostics on a `naive` node read the remote address of a Cronet connection, which has none, and the nil dereference killed the process; the probe now returns status, body and time as for any other node and leaves `remoteAddr` empty. `option/` untouched, so config schema, wire format and tag sets are unchanged; Go 1.26.8; Java surface gains exactly one additive method, `Libbox.hasTunInbound(String)` (javap over all 253 classes: 3493 → 3494 signature lines, that one line the whole diff), which LxBox does not call. |
| **v1.14.1-lx.9** | **The XMUX breaker no longer counts a local cancellation as a failure** (§522). Fork SPEC 094 (LxBox issue #148) — closing the http2/h1 response body ourselves, which is what a node switch or an xhttp session retirement does, reached the read side of the xhttp connection as `context.Canceled` / `net.ErrClosed`. The breaker read that as a broken stream: one `ERROR connection download closed: http2: response body closed` per request plus an XMUX session marked failing and evicted, on a node that was fine. lx.9 recognises the local cancellation at the xhttp-conn boundary and neither logs nor counts it; a genuine remote break is reported as before. `option/` untouched, so config schema, wire format, tag sets and submodules are unchanged; Go 1.26.8; Java surface identical to lx.8 (javap diff over all 253 classes — empty). |
| **v1.14.1-lx.8** | **gRPC `service_name` as a request path** (§468). Fork SPEC 093 — a `service_name` with a leading `/` is Xray's absolute-path notation: the core escapes it segment by segment, reads the last segment as the stream name and drops a `|…` tail, so `/a/b/Tun` reaches the wire as `/a/b/Tun` and `/a/Stream` as `/a/Stream`. Without a leading `/` the old behaviour stands — one escaped segment plus the core's own `/Tun`. This removes the reason for the §464 normalisation, which only ever fixed the single-segment form and would now strip a `/` the core expects: contract 1.1.3 drops the rule, and the value goes to the core verbatim on every input. Wire format, config schema, tag sets, toolchain and submodules unchanged; Java surface identical to lx.7 (javap diff over all 253 classes — empty). |
| **v1.14.1-lx.7** | **Validation and named entries in errors** (§462). Fork SPEC 092 — an initialization error now carries the type and the tag of the entry next to its index: `initialize outbound[0] vless[proxy-de-1]: invalid short_id`; six places (DNS server, endpoint, inbound, service, outbound, certificate provider), errors inside the constructors and the libbox API untouched. Came from a user request of 18.09 — LxBox shows the core's text as is, and a bare index names nothing. Contains lx.6, fork SPEC 091 — `tuic.udp_relay_mode` no longer accepts any string it is given (`unknown udp_relay_mode: X (expected native or quic)`), and the masque `uri` is validated against `standard`. Wire format, config schema, tag sets, toolchain and submodules unchanged; Java surface identical to lx.5 (javap diff over all 253 classes — empty). |
| **v1.14.1-lx.5** | **REALITY `short_id` hotfix** (fork SPEC 090): a `short_id` longer than 16 hex characters is rejected with `invalid short_id` before decoding, on the client and on the server; until lx.5 it panicked with `index out of range` inside `hex.Decode` writing into an `[8]byte`. Found by the contract's DRIFT inventory (§461). Wire format, config schema, tag sets, toolchain and submodules unchanged; Java surface identical to lx.4 (javap diff over all 253 classes — empty). |
| **v1.14.1-lx.4** | **REALITY: fragmentation and `key_share`.** Fork SPEC 088 — `tls.fragment` / `tls.record_fragment` now apply to REALITY as well: until lx.4 the REALITY client built its handshake on the bare socket and skipped them silently, including the automatic `record_fragment` under a `detour`. Fork SPEC 089 — a per-node `tls.reality.key_share` (`hybrid` \| `classical`), an unknown value rejects the whole config; LxBox emits it from §457. Wire format, tag sets and toolchain unchanged; Java surface identical to lx.3 (javap diff over all 253 classes — empty). |
| **v1.14.0-lx.39** | **SOCKS5 UDP hotfix** (fork SPEC 085): a UDP ASSOCIATE reply with `BND.ADDR` `0.0.0.0`/`::` no longer makes the client dial the relay at the local system — the proxy server address is used instead. Java surface identical to lx.38. |
| **v1.14.0-lx.38** | **Tailscale in the AAR** — `with_tailscale` plus the `ts_omit_*` trims (§435, contract ## 13, D-103): the `tailscale` endpoint and the `tailscale` DNS server type; AAR +2.58 MB, build time unchanged. Plus the SPEC 084 hotfix (ABBA deadlock of nested selectors, fork issue #20). Upstream base of lx.37 (`upstream/stable` v1.14.0 + 33). Java surface unchanged from lx.36. |
| **v1.14.0-lx.37** | Upstream sync: `upstream/stable` b7eb49bb8 (v1.14.0 + 33), submodules wireguard-go v0.0.6 / sing-tun v0.9.3. No config changes. AAR still without Tailscale. |
| **v1.14.0-lx.36** | Hotfix: REALITY nodes on Xray-core ≥ v26.9.8 work again — the core no longer strips the `X25519MLKEM768` key share the server now requires, and derives the auth key the way the server does (core SPEC 083); servers before v26.9.8 unaffected. Only `chrome` fingerprints carry the key share — LxBox 2.23.2 emitted `chrome` for any REALITY node (§281); since 2.24.0 an explicit fingerprint goes into the config as is, with a warning on the node (§444). Same upstream base as lx.34. |
| **v1.14.0-lx.35** | Hotfix for fork issue #14: XHTTP behind a CDN that resets HTTP/2 streams could pin the CPU at 100 % until restart — the `http2.StreamError` type no longer leaks out of XHTTP / HTTP / gRPC-lite conns into an HTTP/2 client running through the outbound (core SPEC 082). Same upstream base as lx.34. |
| **v1.14.0-lx.34** | The upstream **1.14.0 stable** base (plus 16 post-release commits): a URL test can no longer hang on an unresponsive node (a 15 s deadline per probe), a manual test now probes every node of a group and recurses into nested groups, `_dns.*` SVCB discovery queries get an empty NOERROR so browsers cannot bypass the tunnel over DoH, inverted DNS rules with rule-set address filters match again, QUIC throughput on TUIC/naive survives an idle period, and sing-tun keeps a separate TCP NAT table per address family. Configs unchanged. Java surface: additive only (see the pin section) |
| **v1.14.0-lx.33** | AmneziaWG 3.0/3.1 (§421): AWG 3.x root keys on the `wireguard` endpoint (`header_protection_key`, `content_padding_addition`, ranged timings, `random_trailers`, `disable_cookies`) and a ranged `persistent_keepalive_interval`; `lx.32` introduced the fields, `lx.33` fixes data-packet reception under `random_trailers`. Cores ≤ `lx.31` reject such a config as a whole. Java surface: unchanged |
| **v1.14.0-lx.30** | DNS over an XHTTP `detour` fixed: `udp`/`tcp`/`tls` DNS servers behind a `detour` to a VLESS+XHTTP node died on the first query with `write request: context canceled` — red URL tests for `masque`/`wireguard` nodes probed by domain (green by IP), and a dead system DNS over TUN with the tunnel alive. `DialContext` for `stream-one`/`stream-up` now returns only after the HTTP layer accepts the request body, so the pool cancelling its dial context no longer tears the connection down. Java surface: additive only (see the pin section) |
| **v1.14.0-lx.29** | SPEC 076/059 — XHTTP no longer pins the CPU at 100% when the path resets streams: an xmux circuit breaker (3 consecutive stream failures retire a connection, 100 ms→3 s backoff before a new transport, success counted as *data* not headers). `packet-up` uploads survive a graceful `GOAWAY` (`GetBody` set, so HTTP/2 can retry transparently). A `stream-up` pool leak fixed — the release handle was accepted but never stored, so `openUsage` grew monotonically |
| **v1.14.0-lx.28** | MASQUE `vhttp: auto` becomes the **default** (SPEC 074) — an empty `vhttp` self-rescues into h2 behind a TCP-only hop instead of hanging to the dial deadline; explicit `h3`/`h2` still pin the mode. XHTTP `session_table` / `session_length` (ported from Xray) replace the dashed-UUID session id with a random string of a chosen alphabet/length — purely client-side, and configuring one without the other is an error. Chain per-position runtime toggles (SPEC 075) with cache-file persistence by position tag: this is where the additive Java surface comes from (`ChainPosition.disabled`, `ChainToggleResult`, `CommandClient.setChainPositionEnabled` / `getChainCloneConfig`); LxBox binds none of it |

| rc.20 | The XHTTP GET→POST soft fallback (duplicating §217); a udpnat2 buffer fix; an upstream sync |
| **v1.14.0-lx.1** (stable) | The first stable release of the `lx-1.14` branch (rc.16→rc.22): the MASQUE outbound (§130) and stabilisation; shipped with LxBox v2.9.0 |
| **v1.14.0-lx.11** (stable) | The AWG-over-WireGuard guard was removed (SPEC 007) — AWG-over-AWG/WG now comes up. Device-verified on CPH2411. (The intermediate lx.2…lx.10: idle-suspend L3, the balancer, Force IPv4, the memory limit, AWG padding and reserved-clear fixes — see `docs-lx/lx-changelog.md` in the core) |
| **v1.14.0-lx.14** (stable) | SPEC 030 — Stop no longer hangs for 10+ seconds with many WG/AWG endpoints (silencing the tick, closing UDP sockets upfront, aborting the in-flight wake, and a concurrent close). The core half of §287. Upstream base `alpha.47`. AAR build tags unchanged. (The intermediate lx.12/lx.13 — see `docs-lx/lx-changelog.md` in the core) |
| **v1.14.0-lx.15** (stable) | SPEC 002 — XHTTP behind a reverse proxy: `path` is preserved as-is, and the trailing slash is stripped only on the bare-path stream-one request. Plus a merge of upstream `testing` (the async DNS refactor, a WG detour fix, OpenConnect auth-challenge). Upstream base `alpha.48`. AAR build tags unchanged. Device-verified on CPH2411 (2026-07-21) |
| **v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.3** | SPEC 060 — `record_fragment` turns itself on when an outbound dials through a `detour`. The symptom: `MASQUE detour VLESS` hung for about 15 s and died with `tls handshake: EOF`. The cause is that the lower leg sends our ClientHello under its own name, and when the PMTU beyond that leg is smaller than the ClientHello the packet is lost silently (the ICMP “fragmentation needed” never reaches the client). The threshold is purely about size (1488 B gets through, 1502 B does not) and belongs to the path rather than the protocol; it reproduces with bare `curl`. There is a single injection point, `NewClientWithOptions`, before the engine is chosen, so STD/uTLS/REALITY get the same default. ⚠️ It changes the behaviour of ANY outbound with a `detour`, not just MASQUE. An explicit user choice wins and `fragment: true` is not upgraded; only the first TLS record is rewritten; the direct path is unaffected. SPEC 021 — MASQUE h2 moved onto the shared `common/tls` (it was the only outbound bypassing the shared layer: a bare `crypto/tls.Client` for the sake of pinning the endpoint's ECDSA key), with the pinning moved on top of the shared client; h3 untouched. The Java surface did not change — `classes.jar` is byte-identical to rc.1, no `javap` diff needed. ⚠️ rc: a device run over detour configs in general, plus a check that an explicit `fragment: true` is not upgraded |
| **v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.1** | SPEC 058 — `GetURLViaOutbound`: a diagnostic HTTP GET through a node by tag, returning the response BODY (exit IP, geo, `warp=`), without switching the active selector. The consumer is §392 (the Diagnostics tab). The Java surface **did change**: `+GetURLResult`, `+HTTPHeaders`, `CommandClient.getURLViaOutbound`. ⚠️ GOTCHA: the getters on `GetURLResult` carry **no `get` prefix** (`content()`, `status()`, `elapsedMs()`) — gomobile strips it when the Go field does not start with `Get`. GET only; `maxBytes` 0 → 256 KiB (1 MiB ceiling, truncation = `Truncated`); a non-2xx is a result, not an error; `RemoteAddr` is the address from inside the tunnel, not the exit IP; `ElapsedMs` is not written into the urltest history. ⚠️ rc: the field check from a device is not closed in the core's criteria |
| **v1.14.0-lx.24-rc.2** (v2.20.7) | Catching up with upstream (19 commits on the `v1.14.0-beta.9` base) plus the go1.26.5 toolchain, following upstream (SPEC 044). No changes to the lx-layer code. From the upstream tail: the local transport's DNS caches are partitioned by interface signature; the WG handshake resolves every address of a domain peer and races them (`SetEndpointResolver`); hijacked DNS carries process info; plus fixes to reset network, FakeIP async-save, the Android process finder and unbounded allocations on a malicious SRS. The submodules were rebased before the core (sing-tun plus SPEC 040, wireguard-go plus AWG2/SPEC 041). The Java surface did not change — `classes.jar` is byte-identical to lx.22. ⚠️ rc: the core's release notes require a device run (tunnel/DNS/URL test/WG/AWG) before lx.24 is promoted to stable. lx.23 and lx.24-rc.1 concern the desktop `lxd` daemon and do not affect Android |
| **v1.14.0-lx.22** (v2.20.6) | SPEC 054 — `least_test` reacts to failures of real dials (a “the path is dead” penalty, a fallback dial through the best candidate, emergency ranking at three penalties on the leader). SPEC 053 — REALITY declares `minClientVer` 26.3.27: Xray since v26.7.11 silently serves the camouflage site on a mismatch. The Java surface is unchanged (226 classes, a 0-line javap diff) |
| **v1.14.0-lx.21** (v2.20.5) | SPEC 052 — a `C.TCPTimeout` connect deadline (15 s) on netstack dials: the WG/AWG endpoint (`DialTCPWithBind`, whose stackDevice is shared by the per-connection dials of MASQUE) plus openvpn/openconnect/tailscale through the submodule's `gonet.DialTCPWithBind`. Previously the only boundary was gVisor's SYN backoff (1+2+4+8+16+32+64 = about 127 s; the `TCPSynRetriesOption` knob is dead in our gVisor pin), times N addresses for a domain via `DialSerial`. The symptom: a silent black hole (Wi-Fi cutting UDP to the node, a radio that has gone to sleep) reads as “everything hangs with no error”, leaving the group nothing to react to. 15 s rather than 5 because the budget is shared with the group's health check: a deadline below the probe's would give “the node passes probes but every user dial through it fails”. Measured: 2m07s → 15.05s. The Java surface is unchanged and no client changes are needed |
| **v1.14.0-lx.20** (stable, v2.20.5) | Promoting the `lx.20` branch to stable: substantively equal to rc.8, no code changes. For the branch's contents (SPEC 047 a crash on a network change at startup, SPEC 048 a crash on a connection to a dead node, SPEC 050 stuck node checks, SPEC 051 closing the gap to upstream — 217 commits on the `v1.14.0-beta.8` base) see the v2.20.4 entry in CHANGELOG |
| **v1.14.0-lx.19-rc.3** (v2.19.2) | SPEC 045 — a nil panic during a URL test of trojan/vless nodes with `tls.enabled:false` (the ping test killed the core). No client changes |
| **v1.14.0-lx.19-rc.2** (part of v2.19.2) | **SPEC 044** — an AAR built with Go 1.24 (as the CI did) killed ALL quic-go outbounds (hysteria2/tuic/masque-h3) on devices with a vendor kernel: every dial hung until `context deadline exceeded` and the ping test was permanently `-1`. The same source on Go 1.25 works. The fix is a toolchain change in the core's CI. The client half of the investigation is §341 (the Debug API `/action/quic-knobs`). ⚠️ an emulator with a generic kernel does NOT reproduce the defect |
| **v1.14.0-lx.19-rc.1** (part of v2.19.2) | SPEC 041 v2 — an early rebind (about 15 s instead of about 90) plus the event-driven nudge `CommandServer.RebindStaleEndpoints()`: it rebinds only provably dead sessions (no keypair, or a handshake older than 180 s) and is a no-op for the rest. The consumer is §340 (a wake nudge on `USER_PRESENT`). A new export on the Java surface |
| **v1.14.0-lx.18** (v2.19.1) | SPEC 032 — VLESS `encryption` (`mlkem768x25519plus`, a PQ layer inside VLESS): the field appeared in the core's schema and `security=none` nodes with the crypto layer came back to life. The client side is §335 (moving the field from the subscription into the config, plus the URI round trip). Measured on a device: +12 genuine nodes (ws 7/8, grpc 5/5), the subscription going from 42 to 53 out of 76. A config feature, so the Java surface is unchanged. ⚠️ a core older than lx.18 rejects a config with the field entirely |
| **v1.14.0-lx.17** (stable) | Promoting rc.1–rc.5 plus XHTTP fixes that never shipped in an rc: SPEC 042 (the gRPC Content-Type on streaming requests, parity with Xray) and SPEC 043 (the trailing slash of the `stream-one` path — the root of “the subscription's XHTTP nodes are dead”, a 404 turning into a hang). Device-verified, no client changes |
| **v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.5** (v2.19.0) | The 01.08 upstream sync on top of rc.4: naiveproxy v150, a DNS rule race (a completed rule blocked by one armed earlier), the WireGuard system device not configuring the interface's DNS, a TLS fragment on Windows without TCP estats, a routing loop on darwin. Plus device verification of SPEC 040. Does not touch the Java surface |
| **v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.4** (part of v2.19.0) | SPEC 041 — WG/AWG endpoints heal themselves after the device sleeps (a rebind with a fresh port once the handshake retries are exhausted, about 90 s; a manual `listen_port` disables the self-healing). SPEC 040 — the system TCP stack: the accept loop recreates a killed listener instead of exiting silently (sing-tun as a fork submodule); this closes the §047 failure of “the browser is dead, QUIC is alive”, with the errno on the device being `EINVAL` (§329). Both fixes are inside the core and do not touch the Java surface — no client changes |
| **v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.3** (v2.18.2) | SPEC 039 (rc.2) — rotation of the OOM/crash report archive: 32 directories / 64 MB, deleting by mtime (the device had accumulated 575 directories / 427 MB over 19 days). Plus **240 upstream commits** (URLTest requires history storage in the context). rc.3 — `Endpoint.Close()` returns the tun device's close error again. **The javap diff rc.1 → rc.3: no changes**, and no client changes were needed |
| **v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.1** | SPEC 038 — the fix for the fatal throw in `GetRunningConfig` (returning `RunningConfig` instead of a bare string; see the pin block above). **An API break:** the method's signature changed and the client must call `.content()` |
