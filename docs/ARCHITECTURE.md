# L×Box architecture

This document describes the structure of the L×Box Flutter application, the boundaries of responsibility, the data flows and the native side.

The current parser and builder version is **v2** (spec 026, phase 5 completed in v1.3.0). Details are in [spec/tasks/026F-parser-v2](./spec/tasks/026F-parser-v2/spec.md).

## Supported platforms

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|----------|
| Android minSdk | **24** (Android 7.0) |
| Android targetSdk | `flutter.targetSdkVersion` — set by the pinned Flutter (`app/android/flutter.version`, 3.47.1 → API 36); not overridden in `build.gradle.kts` |
| Android compileSdk | `flutter.compileSdkVersion` — same source (3.47.1 → API 36) |
| JVM | Java 17 |
| NDK | `flutter.ndkVersion` — the NDK the pinned Flutter asks for; not hardcoded in `build.gradle.kts` |

### Support tiers

| Tier | Android | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Primary** | 11+ (API 30+) | Tested, every feature works, production-ready |
| **Best-effort** | 7.0–10 (API 24–29) | It compiles, installs, and the basic VPN functionality should work |
| **Unsupported** | <7 (API <24) | Installation is blocked by `minSdk=24`; below 24 Flutter itself refuses (the engine's floor) |

> **Android TV (§372).** The app declares itself TV-compatible
> (`uses-feature leanback` / `touchscreen`, both `required="false"`, plus a
> `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` intent filter), but it remains **best-effort**: the UI is
> designed for touch and there is no separate leanback interface. Two platform
> quirks to keep in mind when editing:
> TV firmware has **no DocumentsUI**, yet the intent never goes unhandled —
> the system stub `frameworkpackagestubs` intercepts it and silently cancels
> the selection (`resolveActivity` finds it, there is no error, the result is empty).
> That is why every picker goes through
> [`services/file_import.dart`](../app/lib/services/file_import.dart),
> which asks the platform (`hasRealFilePicker`, rejecting the stubs by package
> name) **before** launching the picker and suggests the clipboard or a URL.
> Do not rely on a `file_picker` error code — on TV there will not be one.
> Control comes from a **remote**: anything without a focusable node is
> unreachable, so clickable elements need an `InkWell` or a button. Details:
> [§372](spec/tasks/372-android-tv-support.md).

> **The renderer (§131).** On `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 31` (Android ≤11) Flutter
> is forced off Impeller and onto **Skia** (`getFlutterShellArgs` →
> `--enable-impeller=false` in [`MainActivity`](../app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/MainActivity.kt)).
> The Impeller shaders crash older GPU drivers (Adreno 3xx → a SIGSEGV in `libsc-a3xx.so`).
> Impeller is kept on Android 12+. The gate is by OS version rather than by GPU, since
> Flutter has no clean runtime GPU detection. Details: [§131](spec/tasks/131-impeller-adreno-gpu-crash.md).

### Why 24 is the minSdk

- **24 is the absolute floor**: Flutter supports API 24 at the lowest (`FlutterExtension.minSdkVersion = 24` — unchanged through 3.47.x, the pin currently in use), and libbox.aar is built with `minSdkVersion=23`. Below 24 the app cannot be built at all.
- Historically `minSdk=26` was in place from v1.4.0 (“Android 8.0+” in the 1.3.x release notes); it was lowered to 24 in §233 at users' request, since nothing in the code depended on API 26.
- **The VpnService API** (`setMetered`, `setUnderlyingNetworks`) is available from API 29+, with fallbacks for older versions.
- **`ActivityManager.getHistoricalProcessExitReasons`** (API 30+) is needed for silent-kill detection in diagnostics.
- **`NotificationChannel`** (API 26+) sits behind `SDK_INT >= O` gates; both notification builders handle it.
- **`BoxApplication.fixAndroidStack`** is enabled on exactly API 24–25 — a workaround for those versions.

### The `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` checks

In Kotlin (DefaultNetworkMonitor, ServiceNotification, BoxApplication and others) the version guards are the working tier mechanism.

## Overview

L×Box is an Android VPN client built on **sing-box** (through **libbox**). The full cycle:
subscriptions → parsing → config → the VPN tunnel → control through the **libbox CommandClient**.

### The core: the `sing-box-lx` fork

The VPN core is our fork [`Leadaxe/sing-box-lx`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx)
(upstream sing-box plus AmneziaWG, XHTTP and the LxBox features), controlled through the
libbox CommandClient. The AAR is downloaded by `scripts/fetch-libbox.sh` from the fork's
GitHub Releases, and the version is pinned in `app/android/libbox.version`.

**The full picture — the build tags, the gotchas of a version bump and the rc history — is in
[`KERNEL.md`](KERNEL.md).**

### The layers and their responsibilities

Four layers with one-directional dependencies: **UI → State → Services → Platform**
(never the other way round). Logic never lives in `build()`, and the UI never touches
Platform directly — only through the controllers.

```

**The facade invariant (§291):** a domain exposes a **facade** and knows nothing about its
consumers (no `DebugContext`, widgets or intents appear in its signatures); the external
adapters (Debug HTTP, the Automation broadcast, the UI) know the transport and the security
but not what they grant access to; a shared operation is declared once and every adapter
reduces to calling the facade. The reference shapes: `DirectionMutations` (an atomic
heal plus resync, with the raw statics `@visibleForTesting`), `SubscriptionController`
(which owns the server-list mutations, with Debug and Automation delegating to it),
`ProbeController` (`services/probe/` — a shared probe over the whole ServerList subsystem:
the thresholds, the ping and the pure decisions, plus the `probeNodesOf` adapter;
`ProbeGateMixin` is the shared VPN gate), `DnsController` (`services/dns/` — `load()` into a
snapshot plus `stage()` over the DNS section, leaving the screen thin), and
`VpnSettingsFacade` (`services/vpn_settings/` — `applyVpnMode` carries the password-gen,
auth-force and `has_tun`-mirror invariants for the UI **and** for Debug). The typed storage models are the sealed `DnsServerRef` and `DnsRuleRef` (§294).
The full invariant plus the strangler plan is in `docs/spec/tasks/291F-layered-architecture-facades/`.

**The event brokers (push, bottom-up):** §122 moved the UI's control channel onto the
libbox **CommandClient** (a server-stream push instead of Timer polling). The push channels:
the native status `Stream<TunnelStatusEvent>` (the tunnel's lifecycle), the `lxbox/coreLog`
stream (→ `AppLog` → `TrafficProfiler`) and the CommandClient streams over an EventChannel.
`lxbox/cc/*` (status · outbounds · groups · connections · dns — `vpn/cc_channel.dart`).
Unary pull survives in a couple of places — `getGroups()` (a lifeline where the groups push
is leaky) — plus the top-down imperatives (`urlTestOutbound`, `selectOutbound`, `closeConnection`).
The heartbeat is a watchdog over the **silence** of the status stream, with no HTTP polling.
The detailed flows are in the [Data flows](#data-flows) section.

### The invariant: TWO channels of differing reliability (status versus data) — do NOT mix them up

A fundamental separation; breaking it produces bugs of the form “Connected, but the Channel
and Nodes are empty after a swipe” (see §185):

| Channel | What it carries | Reliability / lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| **The VpnService status broadcast** (the native `Stream<TunnelStatusEvent>` / `BROADCAST_STATUS`) | ONLY the tunnel's **global status** (Connected/Stopped/Connecting/error) | **RELIABLE, always present.** Purely native (an Android Service), it survives the death of the Flutter engine (a swipe-kill under keep-VPN). It is the single source of truth for the status. |
| **The CommandClient streams** (`lxbox/cc/*`: groups · connections · outbounds · status-tick) | **The data shown on screen**: groups and nodes, connections, traffic, per-app | **EPHEMERAL.** Bound to the Flutter engine: the subscriptions live in Dart and the refcount in native. The service and the core live independently of them. |

**keep-VPN-on-exit does NOT stop the core** — that is the CORRECT behaviour (`BoxService.onTaskRemoved` under keep is a no-op, and the core plus the CommandServer keep running). A swipe kills only the UI engine; the status keeps arriving over the broadcast, while the CommandClient data must come back up on the next launch.

**The lifecycle of the CommandClient clients — THREE native↔Dart synchronisation points:**
1. **Going into the background** (the engine is alive) — put screen and status to sleep (`pauseScreen` / `pauseStatus`); leave the profiler alone (it keeps recording in the background, §164).
2. **Returning from the background** (the engine is alive) — bring them back up, in pairs (`resumeScreen` / `resumeStatus`).
3. **A cold start of Flutter** (a new engine) — reset the native CommandClient state to clean (refcount=0, drop the dangling subscriptions and sinks) and let the new UI connect from scratch. The reliable hook is `onAttachedToEngine` (Dart may have died abruptly on a swipe without unsubscribing).

**The profiler keeps its buffer in Dart** (`TrafficProfiler`), while its native `profilerClient` lives on in the background (§164 does not pause it). The consequence: a recording exists only while the Flutter engine is alive — by design the profiler records while the app is open. On a cold start the native side is reset.

### The “cohesion over line count” principle (§089)

The goal of the §089 structural refactor was **a single responsibility plus cohesion**, not
a line count. Six hundred lines are legitimate when the file is one cohesive responsibility.
Large files are decomposed through `part` or `mixin` (the same library, so library-private
access is preserved) or by extracting widget subtrees. The documented large exceptions
(where a split would add risk without benefit):

| File | Lines (2026-09-30) | Why it stays whole |
|---|---|---|
| `services/traffic_profiler.dart` (+ `traffic_profiler/internal.dart`, `models.dart`) | 873 | A stateful singleton: receiving the CC connections and DNS streams, diffing snapshots, confidence and the dual SSE fan-out — all through shared private state and one `ChangeNotifier` contract; the models and internals are already split out. |
| `models/custom_rule.dart` | 1232 | Sealed into `Inline`/`Srs`/`Preset`; the size is inherent to three structurally different kinds. |
| `android/.../VpnPlugin.kt` | 1561 | One `MethodCallHandler` contract; splitting it would scatter the channel contract across files. |

The list above is the set of *reviewed* exceptions, not the set of large files.
Nothing enforces the principle: as of 2026-09-30, 23 Dart files under `app/lib`
exceed 1000 lines (`find app/lib -name '*.dart' | xargs wc -l | sort -rn`), the
largest being `services/lx_backup.dart` (4493), `services/parser/engine/interpreter.dart`
(4181), `controllers/subscription_controller.dart` (3582),
`services/contract/body_sanitizer.dart` (2831), `controllers/home_controller.dart`
(2037) and `services/parser/engine/emitter.dart` (2012). None of them has been
reviewed against the principle; they are debt, not documented exceptions.

### ConfigNode / ParsedConfig (§091 — implemented)

`ConfigCache` + `ConfigIntrospection` + reverse-map `subscriptionsOfTag`
are collapsed into `ParsedConfig` — a `Map<tag, ConfigNode{tag, type, section, detour,
isMarkedDetour, detourRefCount, raw, transportLabel, securityLabel}>`,
It is parsed once per change of `configRaw` (the `HomeState.configModel` field);
the pings are a separate dynamic layer, joined at render time (`NodeViewItem`).
Membership of a subscription is a **prefix filter** over the emitted tag
(`home/subscription_lookup.dart`), with no membership in node lists. That removed a whole
class of “the UI reverse-parses the display tag” bugs (§077/§079/§080).

`transportLabel` and `securityLabel` (§102/§103) are eager labels for a node's subtitle
(protocol · transport · security: `tcp`/`ws`/`grpc`/`h2`/`httpupgrade`/`quic`/`xhttp`;
`TLS`/`Reality` plus `+Vision` when `flow=xtls-rprx-vision`; for WireGuard, the
obfuscation level `awg`/`awg2`). They are computed once inside `ParsedConfig.parse`,
not in getters. See [`spec/tasks/091`](./spec/tasks/091-config-node-model.md),
[`102`](./spec/tasks/102-subtitle-transport-variant.md),
[`103`](./spec/tasks/103-variant-filter-chips.md).

## The three-layer Parser v2 pipeline

> Every guard along this pipeline — the points where a value is dropped,
> normalised, defaulted or a node degraded so that the core does not reject
> the whole config — is catalogued in [`GUARDS.md`](GUARDS.md), by layer,
> with `file:line` and the core error each one prevents.

**Invariants:**
- Each `NodeSpec` has round-trip `parseUri(spec.toUri()) ≈ spec`.
- Polymorphic `emit(vars)` — WireGuard → Endpoint, others → Outbound.
- `EmitContext.allocateTag(baseTag)` guarantees global uniqueness across all lists.
- Warnings bubble up: at parse time into `NodeSpec.warnings`, at emit time appended by the emit. (The XHTTP fallback to `httpupgrade` was removed in §097 — the transport is now native.)

### Node parse pipeline: mapper → sanitizer → model (spec 472)

A link used to reach the model through a per-protocol parser that carried its
own value rules, while JSON input carried a second copy of the same rules. The
pipeline below replaces both with one route — the same one the launcher uses.
It was rolled out one protocol per step; every scheme and every input has now
moved (steps 2–8), and `parseUri` dispatches by scheme. What remains outside is
the **sing-box body** input, and by construction: its body is already a sing-box
map, so the step-1 pass judges it verbatim — it needs no mapper, only a route
from the same map into the model.

Since feature 480 the mapper is no longer a set of hand-written translators but
a single **engine** executing registry sections, and the same table drives the
reverse direction — the link the app emits:

```
input ─► detect (registry) ─► engine, by the section of the recognised source kind ─┐
   link / base64 / list / Xray JSON / INI (wg-quick)                                │
                                                                                    ▼
                                   raw map ─► registry sanitizer ─► clean map ─► parseSingboxEntry ─► NodeSpec
                                       │                                                                  │
                                       └─► warnings (code, path, value) ──────────────────────────────────┘

NodeSpec ─► emitter, from the SAME table ─► link            (round trip: parse → emit → parse)

sing-box body ──► (already a sing-box map: the step-1 pass judges it verbatim)
```

- **Detect** picks the **source kind** (a bare link, base64, a list of links,
  an Xray object, an INI config) from the registry, not from a hand-written
  chain of `if`s. The kinds themselves are data too — `source_kinds.json` in
  the vendored registry (`app/assets/contract/registry/source_kinds.json`; the
  form started as our draft, there is no copy left in `contract_draft/`). The
  loader also accepts the older name `sources.json` as a fallback
  (`engine/section_loader.dart`). "Source" on its own means a *subscription* in this
  codebase, hence the `kind`. The branches, in the order they are tried —
  a lower number wins, and the last one is the catch-all:

  | # | Kind | Mapper |
  |---|---|---|
  | 10 | `amnezia_link` | `conf` (unwrapped to one INI text per WG/AWG container, not re-detected) |
  | 20 | `base64_wrapped` | — (unwrapped, then re-detected) |
  | 30 / 32 / 40 / 50 | `singbox_config_array`, `singbox_outbound_array`, `singbox_outbound`, `singbox_config` | `singbox` |
  | 31 / 33 / 34 / 35 | `xray_config_array`, `xray_outbound_array`, `xray_outbound`, `xray_config` | `xray` |
  | 60 | `wireguard_conf` | `conf` |
  | 100 | `uri_lines` | `uri` |

  Xray is told from sing-box by `protocol` against the other's `type`. The
  numbers, not the markers, settle an ambiguous object: a lone outbound
  carrying **both** keys is taken by `xray_outbound` (34) before
  `singbox_outbound` (40) is tried, whereas the two whole-config branches
  (35, 50) each exclude a top-level `type` explicitly. All four Xray shapes
  are accepted on paste, not only the array of configs — a lone outbound, a
  bare array of outbounds and a full config with `outbounds` used to be
  answered with "No valid outbounds in JSON".
- **Engine** (`parser/engine/`) translates the dialect and **judges nothing**:
  parameter aliases, userinfo, port, name, TLS and transport — all in sing-box
  key layout. It holds **no protocol name at all**, comments included
  (`test/parser/engine_no_scheme_names_test.dart`): a scheme's rule lives in
  its registry section, shared with the launcher, so a divergence between the
  two apps is fixed by editing the table rather than by patching both sides.
  Deviations LxBox must keep live as overlays in `assets/contract_draft/`, each
  one a complete copy of the registry entry plus a `_why`.
  The only warnings the engine raises are about the *translation* losing or
  relocating something (`ws_early_data_converted`, `ech_ignored`) — the body no
  longer holds those values, so the sanitizer has nothing to say about them.
- **Emitter** builds the link from that same table, which is what makes the
  round trip hold: a field the parser learns to read is a field the emitter
  writes back, with no second list to keep in step. What a key is *spelled* as
  on the way out is the entry's own business (`emit_as`, `emit.names`) — the
  two spellings of a boolean, `1` and `true`, are different links to a live
  panel.
- `unknown_key` judges a key by what the **section declares**, not by what the
  run happened to read: an entry skipped by its `when`, or belonging to another
  form of the same input, is still a declaration. Otherwise a container form —
  which the lexer spreads into a flat layer of names — would report the very
  keys the node was built from.
- **Sanitizer** (`contract/body_sanitizer.dart`) is the single judge of values.
  Core gates (`min_core`, `platform`) are off at parse time: they depend on the
  running core, the node does not.
- **Edit point** (`contract/body_edit.dart`, §577) is the single place a
  registry rule edits a node body. A build entry carries `authored`
  (`SingboxEntry.authored`, set by `ServerListBuild` where `verbatimBodyOf`
  put the body; the four conditions of §576), parsing reads the same property
  as `parsingAuthoredBody`. On an authored body only hard rules edit (no
  string `type`, the node core gate, a registry rule or relation with
  `core_rejects`); every other rule leaves the body as written and gives its
  code with `applied: false`. The registry gate, the detour yields and the
  uTLS / REALITY heals go through it; global TLS settings do not (they are the
  user's settings, not registry rules).
- **`parseSingboxEntry`** is the only "map → model" route. It is fed the
  **clean** map, so the model is a typed view of what will reach the core.
  It is also, by construction, **the list of body keys LxBox can read** — it
  reads them one by one, by hand. The launcher has no such list (its body stays
  a map all the way through the registry), and the asymmetry has a cost: a key
  nobody wrote a line for vanishes in silence, while the emitter still writes
  that field back for everything it does know. Five such losses surfaced by
  accident during spec 472 alone, plus `tls.certificate` in #140. Since §476
  the list's completeness is a **test**, not a habit:
  `test/contract/body_fields_roundtrip_test.dart` generates bodies filling every
  field of every registry schema and runs each through the same round trip —
  sanitizer, `parseSingboxEntry`, `emit()` — so a field the parser stops reading
  fails the build and is named. What stays outside the trip is listed with a
  reason in `kNotModelled`, and the list is checked for staleness too. Details
  in [`GUARDS.md`](GUARDS.md#the-guard-over-the-guards--no-field-falls-out-of-the-round-trip-476).
- `rawSource` is unchanged: a link keeps its link, JSON keeps its JSON
  (§454–§456).
- A node parsed by the pipeline **skips** the second `emit()`-based annotation
  pass (`annotateWithRegistry`). Not because of duplicates — those are deduped
  by `(code, path)` — but because of `value`: the pipeline's sanitizer sees the
  link's raw value (`fp=HelloChrome_120`), the `emit()` pass sees the
  canonicalised one (`chrome`), and which survived would be decided by call
  order rather than by a rule.

- The three §453 TCP keep-alive keys travel in `UriMapping.extensionFields`,
  which the pipeline merges into the body **before** the sanitizer. They used
  to bypass it — the registry filed them under `dialer.json` → `skipped` and an
  unlisted key is dropped with `unknown_key`, which would have cost the user's
  own setting. Since contract 1.1.6 (§474) `dialer.json` describes them as
  fields and they are judged like everything else; the separate map stays only
  because their *source* is separate (link parameters outside the protocol's
  schema, collected by a shared helper). QUIC schemes pass no such map at all:
  TCP keep-alive is meaningless over UDP, and `Hysteria2Spec`/`TuicSpec` have
  no field for it.

Migrated so far: **trojan**, **vless**, **vmess**, **shadowsocks**,
**hysteria2**, **tuic**, **anytls**, **naive**, **http(s) proxy**, **socks**
and **ssh**. Since §562 the dispatcher holds no scheme names: `parseUri` maps
the link's spelling to a body type through `registrySchemeType`
(`mappers/uri_pipeline.dart`), a map built once per registry load from the
`detect.scheme_in` of every `mappers.uri` section plus the `aliases` of those
protocols (`wg` lives only there). A spelling can carry more than a name —
`naive+quic` differs from `naive+https` by `quic: true`, `proxy-https` from
`proxy-http` by the `tls` block, `socks4` from `socks` by `version` — and that
difference is the section's `scheme_sets` on the way in and `emit.form_from` on
the way out, not the dispatcher's. A section whose `forms[]` include a form the
link engine cannot run (`space: ini`, the base64 `.conf` link) is routed to its
own parser by that form, and the `vpn://` container and provider service lines
are recognised by `source_kinds.json`. Without a loaded registry no link is
parsed; `engine_no_scheme_names_test` forbids scheme literals in the dispatcher.

Step 7 brought over the last two schemes — **masque** and **wireguard/AWG** —
and with them the **second input of the same scheme, the INI text**
(`wg-quick`). A mapper takes the source text, so an INI mapper differs from a
link mapper only in how it reads the input: the output is the same sing-box
map. After §480 the table itself is the registry section for the `conf` source
kind (`registry/protocols/wireguard.json` → `mappers.conf`, our divergences in
the overlay `contract_draft/conf/wireguard.json`); the engine executes it
through the bridge `engine/engine_mapper.dart` → `mapIniViaEngine`, entry point
`parseIniViaPipeline`. The synthetic `wg://` URI that used to stand between
the INI and the parser is gone; `rawSource` stays the INI text byte for byte
(§456). Amnezia's `vpn://` is not a third input but a **container**: it unpacks
the profile into ready INI texts and hands each to the same mapper.

Step 8 brought over the **Xray-JSON** input, and with it the last path that
carried its own value rules. It is the one input whose source dialect is an
**object**, not text: the mapper takes a `Map`, so it has its own pair of types
and its own entry point (`parseXrayViaPipeline`) while the pipeline body stays
shared. After §480 the per-scheme table is the registry section for the `xray`
source kind (`registry/protocols/<scheme>.json` → `mappers.xray`; the xray
overlays were removed in §533, so the registry is the only source), executed
through the bridge `engine/engine_mapper.dart` → `mapJsonViaEngine`; the
section's own `detect` picks the record, so there is no dispatcher by protocol
name left in the code. Three things differ, all of them from the shape of the
input:

1. The mapper runs **outside** the pipeline — parsing a subscription element
   (node order §321, dedup §404, `dialerProxy` chains, names §310/§322) belongs
   to `parseXrayElement`, which calls it and hands the pipeline a ready map.
2. `label` is computed by the caller: an Xray node is named by its **element**
   (`remarks` plus the §322 rules), not by a URI fragment.
3. The `drop_node` verdict travels back out (`XrayDropVerdict`): a bare `null`
   cannot tell "the registry rejected this record" from "there is no body", and
   `dropped[]` belongs to the caller.

`rawSource` stays the pretty-printed **Xray** object, byte for byte (§454) —
the sing-box map is the pipeline's working form, not what the provider sent.
That is also how the step-1 pass over verbatim bodies still recognises that an
Xray node is not its business: the object has no `type` key.

One consequence is worth naming: the `encryption` form check now removes the
node **at parse time** on this input too, as it already did for links and
sing-box bodies (§477). Before step 8 such a node collected the code but stayed
in the list as a working one, and only the build gate took it out.

**QUIC brought one structural change** (step 5). `tls.utls` and `tls.reality`
are forbidden on QUIC schemes, and until this step the *emitter* stripped them
(`TlsSpec.toSingboxForQuic`) — earlier than the sanitizer, which looked at
`emit()`. The registry rule therefore never saw the blocks, and a hand-written
pass (`forbiddenTlsBlockWarnings`, §469) had to report them. On the pipeline
the blocks reach the sanitizer in the mapper's raw map, `forbidden_for` +
`forbidden_codes` removes them and reports `tls_not_applicable_quic` itself,
one code per block. The emitter keeps its strip — a node edited in the Settings
form can still acquire a fingerprint — but it is no longer the only thing
standing between the block and the config.

A mapper takes the link's **raw text**, not a `Uri`: for vmess and shadowsocks
the link is not a URI at all — `vmess://` carries base64 where a URI keeps its
authority, and `Uri` lower-cases authority, which destroys the payload. The two
URI-shaped schemes call `Uri.tryParse` in their own first line. For the same
reason the tag fallback for a nameless link is built from the **body type**
(`shadowsocks`), not from the scheme (`ss`) — the tag is the node's identity.

## Wizard template (`assets/wizard_template.json`)

An asset template read once through `TemplateLoader.load()` (a singleton, deep-copied on each read).

### The template's sections

| Section | Role | Example / where it is used |
|---|---|---|
| `parser_config` | A legacy block (`version`, `parser.reload`); the app does not read it (§593) | Stays in the template for its shape only |
| `dns_options.servers` | The canonical DNS servers (system/google/cloudflare/quad9/adguard). Storage keeps `dns.servers[]` records (§439). | Resolved into bodies by `resolveDnsServersBodies` |
| `dns_options.rules` | The default DNS rules. Storage keeps `dns.rules[]` records (§061 dns-rules-refactor, formerly feature §041; §439). | Resolved by `resolveDnsRulesList` |
| `ping_options`, `speed_test_options` | UI features (HomeScreen, SpeedTest) | Never reach the sing-box config |
| `group_templates` + `default_directions` | §125/§267/§393 — the **SEED** for `directions[]` (on the first launch). The builder reads `directions[]` from storage. |
| `config` | The base of the sing-box config: log, inbounds, the route skeleton | Deep-copied at the start of `buildConfig` |
| `sections[].vars[]` | The UI's global variables — chapter `core` / `routing` / `dns` | Rendered by `TemplateVarListView` |
| `selectable_rules` | The catalog of preset rules (legacy inline plus bundle — spec 033) | The Presets tab on the Routing screen |

### Selectable rules — two modes

A preset in `selectable_rules[]` works in one of two modes:

**Legacy (up to v1.4.x, with no `preset_id`):**
```json
{
  "label": "BitTorrent direct",
  "default": true,
  "rule": { "protocol": ["bittorrent"], "outbound": "direct-out" }
}
```
The user copies it into a `CustomRule(kind: inline | srs)` through `selectableRuleToCustom` — the contents are copied by value.

**Bundle (v1.5+, with `preset_id` set) — spec 033:**
```json
{
  "preset_id": "ru-direct",
  "label": "Russian domains direct",
  "default": true,

  "vars": [
    {"name": "out", "type": "outbound", "default_value": "direct-out", "title": "Outbound"},
    {"name": "dns_server", "type": "dns_servers", "required": false, "default_value": "yandex_doh", "title": "Transport"},
    {"name": "dns_ip", "type": "enum", "default_value": "77.88.8.88", "options": [
      {"title": "77.88.8.88 · Safe", "value": "77.88.8.88"}, ...
    ]}
  ],
  "rule_set":    [ { "tag": "ru-domains", "type": "inline", "format": "domain_suffix", "rules": [...] } ],
  "dns_rule":    { "rule_set": "ru-domains", "server": "@dns_server" },
  "rule":        { "rule_set": "ru-domains", "outbound": "@out" },
  "dns_servers": [
    {"type": "https", "tag": "yandex_doh", "server": "77.88.8.88", "port": 443, "path": "/dns-query", "tls": {"enabled": true, "server_name": "safe.dot.dns.yandex.net"}, "detour": "@out"},
    ...
    {"type": "udp",   "tag": "yandex_udp", "server": "@dns_ip", "server_port": 53, "detour": "@out"}
  ]
}
```
`CustomRule(kind: preset)` stores a **thin reference** — just `{presetId, varsValues}`. The expansion (`preset_expand.dart`):
1. Resolves the variables from `varsValues` (or from `default_value` when the key is absent; a `required` var with no value aborts the expansion).
2. Recursively substitutes `@var` into `rule_set`, `dns_rule`, `rule` and `dns_servers`.
3. Filters `dns_servers` down to the single one whose `tag == vars['dns_server']`.
4. If `@out` resolves to `"direct-out"`, removes `detour` from the DNS servers (direct needs none).

Merging the fragments from different `CustomRule(kind: preset)` entries is an identical-skip by tag plus first-wins with a warning for real conflicts.

### Vars

`WizardVar` is shared between the global `sections[].vars[]` and the preset-local `selectable_rules[i].vars[]`. The supported types:

| `type` | UI | Substitution |
|---|---|---|
| `bool` | SwitchListTile | `"true"` / `"false"` → Dart bool |
| `text` | A TextField (plus a combo popup when `options` exist) | a string |
| `enum` | A dropdown mapping `title → value` | a string (the `value`) |
| `secret` | A TextField with an eye toggle plus Generate | a string |
| `outbound` (preset only) | An OutboundPicker | a string (a tag) |
| `dns_servers` (preset only) | A dropdown over `preset.dns_servers[].tag` | a string (a tag) |

**`options`** accepts two formats (kept legacy-compatible): a string literal (`"foo"` ≡ `{title: "foo", value: "foo"}`) or an object.

**`required: bool`** (default `true`) — an optional var gets a “— (none)” entry in the UI; choosing it clears the value.

```

**Why DoH/DoT in a bundle hardcode `server: "77.88.8.88"` plus `tls.server_name`:**
In sing-box 1.12 a DNS server of type `https` or `tls` addressed by hostname requires a `domain_resolver` (the tag of another server), otherwise the config does not load.

`@dns_ip` applies **only** to the UDP server — replacing the IP for DoH/DoT would break TLS (a certificate mismatch).

## The source tree

The structure after §089: thin screens with `<screen>/` subfolders, controllers split into
parts, and the large services separated by responsibility through `part`s. The per-file roles follow.

### `app/lib/`

```

## Data flows

### 1. Starting the VPN

```
User tap Start (toggle button)
  │  HapticService.onConnectTap()
  ↓
HomeScreen._startWithAutoRefresh()
  │  (no HTTP fetch — auto-update is a separate concern, spec 027)
  ↓
HomeController.start()
  ↓
BoxVpnClient.startVPN() → MethodChannel → VpnPlugin
  ↓
BoxVpnService.onStartCommand()
  ├─ resetScope() → fresh serviceScope
  ├─ startForeground notification
  └─ serviceScope.launch {
       startCommandServer()
       DefaultNetworkMonitor.start(serviceScope)
       Libbox.newService(config) → libbox creates tunnel
     }
  ↓
Broadcast STATUS_CHANGED → "Started"
  ↓
EventChannel → Dart: HomeController._handleStatusEvent()
  ├─ state.configChangedNeedRestart = false
  ├─ HapticService.onVpnConnected() — medium impact
  └─ AutoUpdater.onVpnConnected() — triggers refresh after 2 min
  ↓
CommandClient: connectScreen() → the groups push stream (selectors only) plus
  getGroups() as a unary pull (deterministic filling, since the push is leaky)
  ↓
UI updates: group dropdown, node list, traffic bar
```

#### When the core refuses the config (feature 478)

The core validates the config **as a whole** and refuses to start on the first
node it cannot accept, naming it: `initialize outbound[3] vless[🇩🇪 Frankfurt]:
parse encryption: unknown encryption appearance`. One node from a provider
would otherwise cost the user every node, so the start above has a second
branch. There is no pre-start check — a successful start costs nothing:

```
Start
└─ реальный старт ядра (первый, сигнальный)
   ├─ принято → VPN поднят → конец
   └─ отказ
      ├─ ошибка не про узел / без тега / тег не сопоставился → ошибка, как сейчас → конец
      └─ ошибка называет узел → выключить узел + причина
         └─ цикл check (тихо, без туннеля): пересобрать конфиг → checkConfig
            ├─ назван узел → выключить + причина → следующий круг
            │  └─ после 10 кругов → диалог
            │     ├─ Keep checking → следующий круг, дальше без предела
            │     └─ Stop → конец, VPN не поднят, выключенные остаются выключенными
            ├─ ошибка не про узел / тот же тег назван повторно → ошибка → конец
            └─ чисто → реальный старт ядра (второй, финальный)
               ├─ принято → VPN поднят → плашка «выключено N» → конец
               └─ отказ → ошибка, как сейчас → конец
                  (если ошибка называет узел — он тоже выключается с причиной,
                   но третьего старта нет: следующее нажатие Start начнёт заново)
```

Two real core starts per press, signalling and final; everything between them
is `Libbox.checkConfig` with no tunnel and no service. The loop is finite by
construction — each round switches one node off, and a round with nothing to
switch off breaks out (PARSING_PRINCIPLES §9.5).

The automaton (`services/core_reject/core_reject_guard.dart`) is pure: the
core, the config build and the storage reach it through the `CoreRejectHost`
interface, implemented over the controllers in
`screens/home/core_reject_host.dart`. The core's error arrives asynchronously
on the status event, so the real start is awaited through a completer
(`HomeController.startAndAwaitVerdict`). The error string is parsed by PARSING_PRINCIPLES
§9.1–§9.2 (`core_error_parse.dart`) and the tag is resolved to its source node
through `BuildResult.nodeByEmittedTag`, the reverse map the same build
produced (§9.3) — so a derived entry (a chain hop, a folder member, WARP, a
subscription prefix) leads back to the node the user owns. Starts with no UI
(auto-start, the §428 watchdog, the QS tile, the §047 Intent API) have no
dialog, so the round limit stands and the answer is always Stop. The stored
verdict is in `STORAGE.md`; the invariants are in `GUARDS.md`.

### 2. Adding a subscription and auto-config

```
Paste/QR/file → SubscriptionsScreen._add() | _pasteFromClipboard()
  ↓
SubscriptionController.addFromInput(text)
  ├─ isSubscriptionUrl → add SubscriptionServers entry + _fetchEntry
  ├─ isWireGuardConfig → parseWireguardIni → UserServer entry
  ├─ isDirectLink → parseUri → UserServer entry
  └─ isJsonOutbound → parseAll(decode(json)) → UserServer entries
  ↓
_persist() — writes to lxbox_settings.json
  ↓
_regenerateAndSave() — auto (v1.3.1+)
  ├─ generateConfig() — no HTTP, local assembly only
  └─ homeController.saveParsedConfig(config)
        ├─ changed = canonical(new) != canonical(state.configRaw)   (§116 text diff)
        ├─ needRestart = changed && (tunnelUp || prev)              (§323 — no longer sticky
        │                                                            when changed == false)
        └─ if (needRestart && tunnelUp): ask the core                (§324)
              formatConfig(saved + OverrideOptions) vs runningConfigRaw
                fresh   → needRestart = false   (cosmetic-only difference)
                stale   → keep
                unknown → keep (conservative: core could not answer)
  ↓
UI refreshes row (subtitle: "<PROTOCOL> server") + snackbar
  ↓
If tunnelUp: pink "Config changed — restart VPN" banner (spec 003 §8a)
```

### 3. Subscription auto-update (spec 027)

```
Trigger: appStart | vpnConnected+2min | periodic(1h) | vpnStopped | manual(force)
  ↓
AutoUpdater.maybeUpdateAll(trigger, force)
  ├─ if _running → skip (dedup)
  ├─ candidates = entries.filter(_shouldUpdate)
  │   └─ _shouldUpdate: enabled ∧ !frozen(fails>=5) ∧ !minRetry(15min) ∧ (force ∨ interval elapsed)
  │       (§129: the auto-updater skips subscriptions with url=file:<uuid> — they are read from the cache)
  └─ for entry in candidates:
       ├─ _inFlight.contains(url) → skip
       ├─ refreshEntry(entry, trigger)  → _fetchEntryByRef
       │    ├─ lastUpdateStatus==inProgress → skip (crash-safe guard)
       │    ├─ mark inProgress + persist
       │    ├─ parseFromSource(UrlSource)
       │    ├─ HttpCache.save(url, body, headers)
       │    └─ copyWith(lastUpdated, lastUpdateStatus, nodes, consecutiveFails)
       └─ sleep 10s ± 2s (between subs)
```

### 4. Subscription metadata

```
HTTP Response Headers:
  profile-title: base64:...           → subscription display name
  subscription-userinfo: upload=N; ...→ traffic quota + expire
  profile-update-interval: 24         → updateIntervalHours
  support-url: https://t.me/...
  profile-web-page-url: https://...
  content-disposition: filename="..." → fallback for title (v1.3.0+)
  ↓
Stored in SubscriptionMeta → SubscriptionServers.{name, meta, updateIntervalHours}
  ↓
Displayed in:
  - Subscription list row: "124 nodes · 🔄 24h · 🕐 3h ago · (2 fails)"
  - Subscription detail → Subscription block (URL, interval picker, status, refresh)
  - Source tab: live GET with headers view
```

### 5. Persistent storage

L×Box's state lives in two places with different semantics:

- **`wizard_template.json`** is the **catalog**: what exists at all (the presets, vars, sections and defaults).
- **`lxbox_settings.json`** is the **user state**: what the user chose and configured (the vars overrides, sources, rules, and so on). Since §439 sources, chains, rules and DNS records are stored as contract 1.0 records ([STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md#storage-form-and-migration-439)).

#### Catalog (template, bundled in APK)

```
app/assets/wizard_template.json     # rootBundle.loadString(), template_loader.dart
├── parser_config           # §026 — legacy, not read by the app (§593)
├── dns_options             # §043+§044 — default DNS servers + rules
├── ping_options            # §040 — default URL + presets
├── speed_test_options      # §015 — speed-test endpoints
├── group_templates         # §267 — the magic_nodes registry plus the direction/auto templates (the SEED for directions)
├── default_directions[]    # §267 — the direction seed (vpn-1..2); the builder reads directions[] from storage
├── sections[]              # §022 — the Wizard UI chapters (the vars grouped by topic)
├── config                  # the native sing-box section with @var placeholders
│   ├── log / dns / inbounds / endpoints / outbounds / experimental
│   └── route               #   rules[] / rule_set[] / final / default_domain_resolver
└── selectable_rules[]      # §033 — the preset catalog: block-ads, ru-direct, and the rest
                            #   ru-inside, bittorrent-direct, private-ip-direct
```

#### Contract registry (bundled in APK, §460)

```
app/assets/contract/VERSION              # the contract version (1.1.0)
app/assets/contract/registry/*.json      # tls, transports, multiplex, dialer, warnings, allowlists…
app/assets/contract/registry/protocols/  # the body schema per protocol (vless, naive, wireguard…)
```

`assets/contract/` is a **mirror** of the vendored copy `app/contract/`, laid down by
`tool/sync_contract.sh`. The copy itself is gitignored (its source of truth is the launcher
repo), but the registry has to reach the APK — CI and the F-Droid buildserver have no launcher
checkout, and a missing asset directory fails `flutter build` outright. So exactly the files the
app reads live in git, and `tool/check_contract_lock.dart` refuses a mirror that drifted from the
copy. Flutter asset directories are not recursive, hence `registry/` and `registry/protocols/`
are declared separately in `pubspec.yaml`.

**The flow.** `main()` calls `ContractRegistry.I.load()` before `runApp` (its own try/catch — a
load failure is logged and the app runs without the registry, as it did before §460). Then, in
every `buildConfig`, `applyRegistryGate` runs the schema sanitiser over each `outbounds[]`/
`endpoints[]` entry produced from node sources: unknown keys and values the core would reject go
away before the config reaches libbox, and the warnings carry the registry's own text in the UI
language. Direction groups and the template's service outbounds are not node bodies and are not
touched. A valid config comes out byte-identical — the gate removes, it does not rewrite or
reorder.

**The documentation mirror (`docs/contract/`, §460 W2b).** The same script lays down a second
mirror — the pages `contract/docs/generated/**`, byte for byte, into the committed `docs/contract/`
at the repo root. These pages are written by the launcher's `tools/gendocs` generator out of the
registry; we do not keep a generator of our own, because the registry here is the same one under
the same `contract.lock`. The mirror exists so that the "Learn more" link on a warning card points
into our repository: the release APK matches `main`, and the launcher's own pages run ahead of the
contract the installed build was compiled against. The pages do **not** go into the APK — the text,
the cause and the remedy already live in the registry and are shown offline; the link is for
someone who wants the whole page. `docs/contract/README.md` is the only file the script writes
itself (contract version, the `contract.lock` sha, "do not edit by hand"); the pages carry no added
header, or they would not be byte-identical. `contractWarningDocUrl(code)`
(`services/contract/contract_docs.dart`) builds the address; the anchor is the code itself, since
gendocs emits an explicit `<a id="<code>"></a>` before each section. Two guards watch the mirror:
`tool/check_contract_lock.dart` compares it file-by-file with the copy, and
`test/contract/docs_mirror_test.dart` checks that every registry code still has an anchor and that
the README names the version that ships in the APK.

```

##### The three storage levels of the native prefs (§189 / §192)

Six Android settings (`auto_start`, `keep_on_exit`, `background_mode`,
`core_logs_enabled`, `allow_bypass`, `auto_redirect`) live at three levels:

| Level | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **disk / the truth** | `lxbox_settings.json` → the `native_prefs` section | the source of truth |
| **memory** | the native `SharedPreferences` `boxvpn_boot.*` | a working copy for the **Dart-less** moments |
| **in-memory** | `SettingsStorage._cache` | a lazily loaded cache of the JSON inside the Dart process |

**Why a native copy is needed:** some code runs when the Flutter engine is
unavailable and there is nothing to read the JSON with — `BOOT_COMPLETED` (the
`BootReceiver` auto-start), a swipe `onTaskRemoved` (the keep-on-exit decision),
and `openTun`/`establish` (allow_bypass, per-app). These points read the native copy **synchronously**.

**The write-through path plus the sync at startup:** any `SettingsStorage.setNativeBool` or
`setNativeBackgroundMode` writes the JSON first and then mirrors into native (over the method
channel); native **never** writes the JSON. At startup (`bootstrapAndSyncNativePrefs()` from
`main.dart`): no section means bootstrap (a native⇒JSON seed, the only native⇒JSON write);
a section present means sync (JSON⇒native, the disk overwrites memory and the divergence
repairs itself). Every writer (the UI, the `backup_service` import, the Debug API) must go
through this layer — direct native writes are ephemeral (the sync rolls them back).
[`lib/services/settings_storage/native_prefs.dart`](../app/lib/services/settings_storage/native_prefs.dart).

**`has_tun` (§192)** is a seventh native key, **derived** from `vpn_mode` (§119):
`vpn` and `vpn_proxy` yield `true`, `proxy` yields `false`. It is mirrored on a mode change and
at startup; it gates `VpnService.prepare()` (in proxy mode `prepare` is never called — it would
pointlessly claim the VPN slot and revoke another active VPN). Being computed, it is neither in
the backup block nor in the `native_prefs` JSON section — it lives only in `boxvpn_boot.has_tun`.

#### Builder (template + user-state → final config)

`build_config.dart` merges the template's `config` section plus `selectable_rules[*]` (through `expandPreset`) and the storage state into the final config.

**Idle-suspend (§128/§215, the core's SPEC 020).** Configuring the threshold (the storage key `route_idle_suspend`).

The storage migration (`SettingsStorage`, §439): a document without `storage_version`
is converted inside `_load()` — the frozen 2.23.2 readers (`storage_migration/legacy_form_v0.dart`)
read `server_lists` / `chains` / `custom_rules` / `dns_options` into models, the record
codec writes `sources[]` / `rules[]` / `dns{}`, node references become NodeLinks, folder
members `autogroup://` become `kind: auto` records, keys with no readers are removed and
`channels` is renamed; the original bytes go to `lxbox_settings.json.v0.bak` once. The same
`migrateStorageDoc` runs on the old-form inputs: a workspace slot, the internal backup, Debug
`POST /backup/import`. `config.json` built from one state before and after the migration is
byte-identical (golden tests). Details: [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md#storage-form-and-migration-439).

Removed earlier: `migrateProxySources` (`proxy_sources` → `server_lists`), `_absorbLegacyAppRules`,
the `enabled_rules` / `rule_outbounds` conversion (§159); `_migrateLegacyDnsServers`
(pre-§044 DNS server shapes, §439).

Sensitive fields are filtered on `GET /state/storage` by the denylist scrubber in `services/debug/serializers/storage.dart`.

### 6.5. Traffic profiler (§044 / §048)

`TrafficProfiler` is a singleton ChangeNotifier holding a system-wide
rolling buffer of events. Everything is in memory; persistence is deliberately absent. Spec: [`docs/spec/tasks/044F-per-app-traffic-profiler/spec.md`](./spec/tasks/044F-per-app-traffic-profiler/spec.md).

```

> The per-app session layer was removed in **§288**: the `App` tab, the `Session` class and

> Only the system-wide mode remains; one application's traffic is inspected through the
> per-app filter on the Profiler tab.

**The event sources (§180/§044 — with NO core-log parsing):**
- **The DNS stream (§180, the core's SPEC 018)** — `CcChannel.dnsQueries` (the `lxbox/cc/dns` channel, `subscribeDNSQueries`), with the attribution coming from the core.
- **The connections stream (§168)** — the CommandClient `connections` push (`CcChannel.connections` through the background `profilerClient`).
- The connection-issue classifier: `dnsTimeout` (the structural `q.failed` from the DNS stream) plus `tcpReset` (a heuristic).

**Global, system-wide recording (§048).** The **Profiler** tab (formerly Live) in Statistics is the only mode.

**Memory bounds:**
- `_globalRollingBuffer`: a retention window (§044, 10 minutes by default) plus a hard cap of 20000.

**UI plumbing (§160/§044):**
- `StatsScreen` has three tabs: Stats / Conns / **Profiler** (system-wide, formerly Live). The `App` tab was removed in §288.
- The `TraceExplorer` engine: a control row (pause · retention · grouping · the filter window).

**Coupling (important for extraction):**
- **`CcChannel` (the CommandClient) is the only source.** The profiler listens to `CcChannel.connections` plus `CcChannel.dnsQueries`.
- **The core's contract (SPEC 017/018).** The `chain()`, `detour()` and `DnsQuery.*` fields are native methods of the libbox AAR.

### 6.6. WARP / MASQUE (§025 · §130)

The Cloudflare WARP integration (`services/warp/`, the wizard `screens/warp_wizard_screen.dart`, storage in `settings_storage/warp.dart`):

- **WARP over WireGuard (§025).** `WarpClient` registers the device itself (a POST to Cloudflare); the private key never leaves the phone.
- **MASQUE (§130, the flagship of v2.9.0).** Separate cryptography (`masque_keys.dart` — ECDSA P-256, not the WireGuard keys).
- **The endpoint generator (§284/§305).** The **“Make experiment”** button in the wizard (`services/warp/scan/`).
- **The endpoint pool (§305, device-verified).** `assets/warp_endpoints.json` is grouped by transport:
  - `wireguard`: `v4_cidr` · `v6_cidr` · `ports` (2408/500/1701/4500 — the verified ones) · `ports_extra`
  - `masque` (§420): общие `hosts_preset` + `recommended_host` (оба транспорта) · `h3.hosts_extra` (h3-only) · `h2.v4_cidr` + `h2.exclude` · `h3.ports` / `h2.ports` · `sni_pool`. Старые плоские ключи (`v4_cidr`, `h3_v4_cidr`, `ports_h3/h2`) читаются как фолбэк.

  The physics of MASQUE (tested for real through a working tunnel): **h2** works on every port.

### 6. AppLog (per-source ring buffers, §043)

`AppLog` keeps in-memory ring buffers **per source** — `app=300`, `core=500`.

```

```

**Key design rules:**
- `coreLogSink` (a volatile companion field in `BoxVpnService`) receives the sing-box callbacks from any thread.
- `EventChannel.EventSink.success()` requires the **main thread**, so we dispatch through `coreLogMainHandler`.
- Forwarding is gated by the `Libbox.setup(SetupOptions{debug: ...})` flag (read from the `BootReceiver` prefs).

### 7. The detour dependency graph (§355)

```
activeConfigRaw (on change) ──► DependencyGraph.fromConfig (models/dependency_graph.dart)
                              the statics: node/dns --detour--> node|direction; the group membership
delayByDirection (measurements) ──┐
groups stream (the selection) ──┴─► HomeController._recomputeDependencyHealth()
                              computeSick: a dead node (every measurement is ERR) → a BFS upward
                              along the reverse edges (a selector's choice infects the direction;
                              a urltest is sick only when its whole membership is dead — §308
                              heals itself)
  ↓ (only when the result changes)
HomeState.sickRoots (a root → the affected DNS entries and nodes, with the via path)
  ├─ NodeRow: a ⚠ mark next to the root's name → tap → dependency_sheet
  └─ a DNS victim appears → lastError = DnsViaDeadNodeMsg (a banner; it clears once every
     DNS victim is gone)
```

No new network activity: only the events that already exist.
The health model and the non-goals are in [the §355 spec](spec/tasks/355-detour-dependency-health-warnings.md).

## Dart `BoxVpnClient` API surface

A thin client over three channels (`com.leadaxe.lxbox/methods` plus two EventChannels).

**Singleton + DI:**
- In production it is `BoxVpnClient.I` (or `BoxVpnClient()`, an alias of the singleton kept for backward compatibility).
- Tests — `BoxVpnClient.forTest(methods: mock, events: mock)`. `@visibleForTesting`.

**The method groups** (in the same order as the `_Methods` constants):

| Group | Methods | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Config | `saveConfig` / `getConfig` | `getConfig` falls back to `'{}'` so the builder can parse without a null check |
| VPN lifecycle | `startVPN` / `stopVPN` / `reloadVPN` / `resetNetwork` / `getVpnStatus` / `getCoreVersion` / `quitApp` | — |
| Settings (the boot prefs and native toggles) | auto_start, keep_on_exit, core_logs_enabled, allow_bypass, auto_redirect | — |
| Per-app routing | `getInstalledApps` / `getAppIcon` / `getAppInfo` | Icons are lazy — `getInstalledApps` returns none |
| System helpers | `isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations` / `open*Settings` / `*NotificationPermission` / `*NearbyWifiPermission` | — |
| Quick Settings | `requestAddTile` | API 33+ |

**Status stream design:**

```dart
late final Stream<TunnelStatusEvent> onStatusChanged = _events
    .receiveBroadcastStream()
    .map(...)
    .asBroadcastStream();
```

`late final` matters: before v1.4.0 every getter created a new stream and the native `EventChannel` leaked sinks.

**Timeout policy:**

Every MethodChannel call is wrapped in a `.timeout()` with a per-method value.

| Category | Timeout | Why |
|---|---|---|
| status / settings | 3s | Lightweight read/write of preferences |
| config | 5s | File I/O |
| app metadata (per-package) | 5s | One PackageManager query |
| The installed-apps list | 15 s | `PackageManager.getInstalledApplications` is expensive |
| startVPN | 30s | System dialog timing + libbox setup |
| stopVPN | 10 s | It blocks until `setStatus(Stopped)` |
| reloadVPN / resetNetwork | 5-10s | Wait for `serviceReload` / `closeAll + DNS flush + dialer rebind` |
| requestAddTile | 10s | System dialog confirmation |

**On a timeout** it logs into `AppLog` and falls back to a safe default (for example `tunnel: disconnected`).

## Native Architecture (Kotlin)

### Class layout (§049 F1 split)

In the §049 audit we ported the pattern from the SagerNet reference (`bg/BoxService.kt`, commit 3b3883e, libbox 1.12).

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why the split:** before §049 `BoxVpnService` implemented both `PlatformInterface` and `CommandServerHandler`.

### Structured Concurrency

```
BoxService (per instance, recreated with every new BoxVpnService)
  └─ serviceScope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.IO)
       ├─ resetScope() in startSingbox (cancel is terminal)
       ├─ All coroutines tied to service lifecycle
       ├─ DefaultNetworkMonitor receives serviceScope
       │    └─ checkUpdate() uses scope.launch — dies with service
       └─ doStop() calls serviceScope.cancel() as safety net
```

**`AtomicReference` for fileDescriptor and commandServer** (§049 F2/F3): `getAndSet(null)?.close()` guarantees a single close.

### Channel Contract

The three Flutter–Android channels live in `VpnPlugin.kt`:

| Channel | Type | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| `com.leadaxe.lxbox/methods` | MethodChannel | Bidirectional (Dart → Native; Dart ← Native for `wifi_history`) |
| `com.leadaxe.lxbox/status_events` | EventChannel | Native → Dart (TunnelStatus broadcasts) |
| `lxbox/coreLog` | EventChannel | Native → Dart (sing-box log lines) |

**The MethodChannel methods** (the groups follow the `_Methods` constants in `box_vpn_client.dart`):

| Group | Method | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Config** | saveConfig | `config: String` | bool |
| | getConfig | — | String |
| **VPN lifecycle** | startVPN | — | bool (may trigger system VpnService dialog) |
| | stopVPN | — | bool — it **blocks** natively until `setStatus(Stopped)` so the caller can proceed safely |
| | reloadVPN | — | bool — `box.serviceReload()` with no status flap |
| | resetNetwork | — | bool — light recovery: `closeAllConnections + DNS flush + dialer rebind`. Tunnel must be up. |
| | getVpnStatus | — | "Started" \| "Starting" \| "Stopped" \| "Stopping" \| "Unknown" |
| | getCoreVersion | — | String — sing-box version + tags |
| | quitApp | — | bool (it returns immediately and the process dies in about 250 ms) — `finishAffinity` plus `Process.killProcess` |
| **Settings (boot prefs / native toggles)** | getAutoStart / setAutoStart | bool | bool — auto-start VPN on boot (`BootReceiver`) |
| | getKeepOnExit / setKeepOnExit | bool | bool — keep the VPN running when the Flutter process is killed |
| | getCoreLogsEnabled / setCoreLogsEnabled | bool | bool — §043 forwards the sing-box logs into Dart's `AppLog`; it needs a restart |
| | getAllowBypass / setAllowBypass | bool | bool — §049 F15 `VpnService.Builder.allowBypass()`; applied on the next start |
| | getBackgroundMode / setBackgroundMode | "never" \| "lazy" \| "always" | bool — §052 foreground-service tunnel sleep mode |
| **Notifications** | setNotificationTitle | `title: String` | bool — a custom foreground notification title |
| | setNotificationText | `text: String` | bool — §123 a custom foreground notification text |
| **Per-app routing helpers** | getInstalledApps | — | A List<Map> (`package` / `appName` / `isSystemApp`) — icons excluded |
| | getAppIcon | `packageName: String` | String (base64 PNG) |
| | getAppInfo | `packageName: String` | A Map (name plus isSystem, **no icon** — §109) \| `{notFound: true}` |
| **System helpers** | isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations | — | bool |
| | openBatteryOptimizationSettings | — | bool — the primary `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` prompt, with a fallback |
| | openAppDetailsSettings | — | bool |
| | openAppSettings | — | bool — the App Permissions screen (a three-level OEM fallback) |
| | areNotificationsEnabled | — | bool |
| | openNotificationSettings | — | bool |
| | checkNotificationPermission | — | bool — `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` on API 33+, true before that |
| | requestNotificationPermission | — | null — asynchronous; the UI must re-check through `checkNotificationPermission` |
| | checkNearbyWifiPermission | — | bool — `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` on API 33+, true before that |
| | requestNearbyWifiPermission | — | null — async; re-check |
| | showToast | `msg: String, duration: "short"\|"long"` | bool |
| **Quick Settings tile** | requestAddTile | — | bool — `StatusBarManager.requestAddTileService` (API 33+) |
| **Diagnostics** | getApplicationExitInfo | — | List<Map> (API 30+) |
| | getLogcatTail | `count?, level?` | String |

**EventChannel `status_events`** — `TunnelStatusEvent`:
```json
{ "status": "Started" | "Starting" | "Stopped" | "Stopping", "error": "..." }
```

**The `coreLog` EventChannel** carries the sing-box log lines, one line per event. The filter skips TRACE and DEBUG.

---

### Permissions (Manifest + runtime)

**Manifest declarations** ([AndroidManifest.xml](../app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)):

| Permission | Why | Granted at runtime? |
|---|---|---|
| `INTERNET` | sing-box egress | install-time |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SYSTEM_EXEMPTED` | The VPN service is a visible foreground service | no |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | auto-start on boot | install-time |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | foreground service notification (API 33+) | runtime, default off |
| `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` | per-app split-tunneling list, app-picker | install-time |
| `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` | one-tap battery whitelist prompt (API 23+) | install-time + system one-tap dialog |
| `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` | sing-box wifi rules / WifiInfo helpers | install-time |
| `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` / `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | A pre-API-29 fallback for the WifiInfo SSID | at runtime, off by default |
| `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` | Required on API 29+ for `WifiManager.connectionInfo` from the background | through Settings |
| `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` (`neverForLocation`) | Required on API 33+ for a real SSID/BSSID; without it the SSID reads as unknown | at runtime |

**The `neverForLocation` flag** on `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` declares to Google Play that the permission is not used to derive a location.

**Permission gating in `BoxService.startSingbox`** ([BoxService.kt](../app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt)):

After `startOrReloadService` (which parses the config) sing-box exposes `commandServer.needWIFIState()`.

Permission matrix:

| API | What `WifiInfo.ssid` requires |
|---|---|
| API 28- | `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` |
| API 29-32 | `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` |
| API 33+ | `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` plus `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` (without NEARBY it reads `<unknown ssid>`) |

**A defensive try/catch in `PlatformInterfaceWrapper.readWIFIState`** ([PlatformInterfaceWrapper.kt](../app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/PlatformInterfaceWrapper.kt)):

#### The JNI no-throw invariant (§050 · §151)

A cross-cutting rule for **every** Kotlin callback that libbox invokes.

**Runtime grant flow** (Flutter side):

```
[Connect tap]
   ↓
BoxService.startSingbox detects needWIFIState() && missing permissions
   ↓
stopAndAlert("alert:permission_location:<perms>")
   ↓
HomeController.lastError = "Stopped: alert:permission_location:..."
   ↓
home_screen._handleStatusEvent catches the prefix → an AlertDialog
   ↓
[Allow Wi-Fi info]               [Open Settings]
runtime prompt (NEARBY)          MANAGE_APP_PERMISSIONS intent
                                 → three fallback strategies:
                                   1. MANAGE_APP_PERMISSIONS
                                   2. MANAGE_PERMISSION_APPS
                                   3. ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS
   ↓                                    ↓
re-check via checkNearbyWifiPermission → user re-Connect
```

`POST_NOTIFICATIONS` goes through an **explainer flow** in `home_screen._maybeShowNotificationPermissionDialog`.

### VPN Lifecycle & Status Sync

The tunnel's model: **`BoxVpnService` is an Android foreground service that lives separately from the Flutter process.**

1. **The Flutter process is alive and so is the service** — normal operation.

2. **The Flutter process died while the service lives on** — this happens with `keep-on-exit = true`.

3. **The system killed the service** — an OOM, a libbox crash, or a revoke by another VPN.

#### The pull-sync mechanics

The source of truth is `BoxVpnService.companion.currentStatus: VpnStatus` (`@Volatile`, updated on every change).

```
HomeController.init()
  ├─ _loadSavedConfig()
  ├─ _statusSub = _vpn.onStatusChanged.listen(_handleStatusEvent)  ← subscribing to the deltas
  └─ raw = await _vpn.getVpnStatus()                               ← pulling the current value
     └─ _handleStatusEvent({status: raw})  ← the same handler; it decides what to emit
```

Without the `getVpnStatus` pull, case 2 broke: the UI stayed “Disconnected” forever until something happened.

#### Broadcast versus pull — which is used when

| Event | Mechanism |
|---------|----------|
| A transition (`Starting` → `Started`) | broadcast → EventChannel |
| An app reattach (a new Flutter process while the service lives) | a `getVpnStatus` pull in `init` |
| A failed heartbeat (the CommandClient status stream stayed silent past the timeout) | `HomeController._onTunnelDead` |
| A safety timeout (stuck in Starting/Stopping for 10 s) | a `Future.delayed` in `_handleStatusEvent` forces the state |

#### Reconnect flow (v1.4.0+)

`HomeController.reconnect()` composes `_stopInternal` and `_startInternal` with blocking semantics.

```
1. If the tunnel is already down, just start() and return.
2. busy=true.
3. _stopInternal: await _vpn.stopVPN() — native blocks until
   setStatus(Stopped) or a 5 s timeout. An intent-based reset of the sticky flag.
4. If the stop timed out, abort with lastError="Stop timed out".
5. _startInternal: setNotificationTitle + startVPN + intent-based reset.
6. busy=false in the finally block.
```

No `firstWhere` or timeout on the Dart side. The blocking `stopVPN` lives natively.

Before v1.4.0 the reconnect was built on Dart-side coordination through `firstWhere(disconnected)`.

#### The keep-on-exit setting

The toggle lives on the **Mode tab** (§188; before §188 it was VPN Settings → System, §052; before that, App Settings).

With `true`, killing the Flutter process does not oblige the system to stop the service.

The pull sync works regardless of keep-on-exit: if the service happens to be alive, the UI picks up its status.

#### Deep links between the tabs and the settings (§052)

Tabs that depend on a global toggle in the settings (core_logs_enabled, the VPN settings vars) link to it.

Two patterns: a **contextual banner** (a state-dependent hint) and an **overflow item** (state-independent).

- **Statistics → Live and Per-app → the contextual `CoreLogsHintBanner`** ([core_logs_hint_banner.dart](../app/lib/widgets/core_logs_hint_banner.dart))
- **Routing → Tunnel apps → ⋮ → “VPN settings (Core)”** → `SettingsScreen(initialTab: 1)`. State-independent. |
- **Drawer → Debug → ⋮ → “Diagnostics settings”** → `AppSettingsScreen(initialTab: 3)` — a fast path (tabs: 0 General, 1 Appearance, 2 Subscriptions, 3 Diagnostics, 4 Automation; §541). |

## CommandClient (libbox)

§122 — the UI↔core control channel. The Clash HTTP API was removed entirely.

### The model: push streams, not pull snapshots

The core emits changes and the UI subscribes. The old flow of three pollers is gone.

### The native clients (`BoxCommandClient.kt`)

Five independent `CommandClient`s decouple the update rates and the lifecycles.

| Client | Commands | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| `statusClient` | `CommandStatus` (plus `setStatusInterval`) | Always on while the tunnel lives; slowed down in the background |
| `screenClient` | `CommandOutbounds` + `CommandGroup` + `CommandConnections` | Raised by `connectScreen`, paused in the background |
| `profilerClient` | `CommandConnections` + `subscribeDNSQueries` (SPEC 018, §180) | Raised for recording and kept alive in the background |
| `pingClient` | A bare `PingHandler` with no subscriptions — unary RPC only | §175/§209 — lifecycle-independent |
| `tailscaleClient` | A bare client plus `subscribeTailscaleStatus` (task 579) | Raised by `ccStartTailscaleStatus` while the VPN is on and the config has a NETWORKS node; closed by `ccStopTailscaleStatus` and `shutdownAll` |

A subscription in the gomobile facade is `CommandClientOptions.addCommand(int)` plus the `CommandClientHandler` callbacks.

### The Dart layer (`CcChannel`)

Push streams over the `lxbox/cc/*` EventChannel (`status` · `outbounds` · `groups` · `connections` · `dns`):

| Stream / method | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | a push `Stream<CcStatus>` | up/down plus a traffic snapshot; it feeds the heartbeat watchdog |
| `outbounds` | a push `Stream<List<CcOutbound>>` | the list of outbounds |
| `groups` | a push `Stream<List<CcGroup>>` | the selector and urltest groups plus selected/active |
| `connections` | a push `Stream<List<CcConnection>>` | the active TCP/UDP connections plus bytes and packageName/processPath |
| `dnsQueries` | a push `Stream<List<CcDnsQuery>>` | §180 (SPEC 018) — the DNS queries from the core (domain, rcode, latency) |
| `tailscaleStatus` | a push `Stream<List<CcTailscaleStatus>>` (`lxbox/cc/tailscale`) | task 579 — per Tailscale endpoint: tag, `BackendState`, `StateText`; a full snapshot per core update. `startTailscaleStatus()` / `stopTailscaleStatus()` hold the core subscription |
| `getGroups()` | a unary pull returning `List<CcGroup>?` | a deterministic snapshot of the groups |
| `getRules()` | a unary pull returning `List<CcRule>` | a snapshot of the route and DNS rules (for diagnostics) |
| `getPool(tag)` | a unary pull returning `List<CcPoolSlot>?` | §208/§209 — a snapshot of a round_robin group's pool |
| `urlTestOutbound(tag)` | a unary RPC returning `CcDelayResult` | the per-node delay. **The invariant:** an `error` is the only signal of failure |
| `selectOutbound(group, tag)` | unary-RPC | selector switch |
| `closeConnection(id)` / `closeConnections()` | a unary RPC | close one connection or all of them |

**§209 — every unary method above goes through `pingClient`** (which is lifecycle-independent).

The lifecycle signals (`connectScreen`/`disconnectScreen`, `connectProfiler`/`disconnectProfiler`, `pauseClients`).

### Wiring

On a `connected` event `HomeController` subscribes to the `status` and `groups` streams.

### The NETWORKS pseudo-direction (task 579)

Home's Direction list ends with `NETWORKS` when the VPN is on and the config the core runs
(`HomeState.activeModel`) has at least one node that meets all of:

1. its record is in `endpoints[]`;
2. its type is `tailscale`;
3. the registry does not count it as an exit (`exitCapableByRegistry` false: no `exit_node`).

Such a node is in no `selector` or `urltest` group. NETWORKS is a view only: it is not written
to the config or to storage, the dropdown value is a sentinel (`kNetworksDirectionValue`),
not a tag, so a user Direction tagged `NETWORKS` does not clash, and `selectedGroup` (the
real exit) does not change when NETWORKS is picked (`HomeState.networksOpen`). Automation
and the Debug API switch Directions by tag and never reach it. The list shows NETWORKS
instead of the Direction's nodes when it is picked, or when there are no real Directions;
once the nodes are gone the selected real Direction shows again. The rows have no delay test
and no selection; a tap opens `outbound_view_screen` (View details); the delay slot shows the
node state from `CcChannel.tailscaleStatus`. `HomeController._syncTailnetStatus` holds the
core subscription while the VPN is on and a NETWORKS node exists, and re-subscribes when the
node set or the core's config snapshot changes. Code: `services/networks_direction.dart`.

### Gotchas

- **An empty groups push over a live one** — the core can send an empty groups list.
- **No external subscribers** — the command server listens on localhost; third-party Clash clients cannot attach.
- **§193 — connections are single-shot with no pull (an asymmetry with groups).** The `connections` subscription is one-way.
- **§194 — the three connection counters count DIFFERENT things.** Do not conflate them:
  - **The home screen** ([`traffic_bar.dart`](../app/lib/screens/home/widgets/traffic_bar.dart)) shows the core's counter.
  - **Stats** shows the active ones from the list (`closedAt==0`) ≈ `connectionsIn`.
  - **Conns** shows the live ones plus the closed history, as “N active / M total”.

## Localization (l10n, §279 / §285)

en (the base) plus ru and zh (§452); a new language is one natural-key
dictionary plus one template overlay plus one `values-<lang>/`, with no
structural changes. The checkers find languages by their directories, so a new
one is under the CI gates as soon as its files exist.
Switching at runtime needs no app restart, including the native surfaces on a
live VPN service. Since §285 the UI strings are localized through **natural keys**
(the English call-site text IS the key; ARB and gen_l10n are gone). The full
architecture is in [the §279 spec](spec/tasks/279F-localization/spec.md) plus
[the getLocalText review](spec/tasks/279F-localization/getlocaltext.md);
translator-guide — [`l10n.md`](l10n.md).

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib/services/l10n/get_local_text.dart` | `GetLocalText` — the natural-key engine: `.s("en text", args)` |
| `lib/services/l10n/plural_resolver.dart` | `PluralResolver` plus `En`/`Ru`/`ZhPluralResolver` (the CLDR forms; zh has the single `other`) |
| `assets/l10n/<tag>/ui.json` | The natural-key dictionary, one per language: `englishKey → { value: String\|pluralObj, special: … }` |
| `lib/services/l10n/locale_controller.dart` | `LocaleController` — the **sole owner** of the locale-switch pipeline |
| `lib/services/l10n/template_overlay.dart` | The pre-parse overlay of `wizard_template.json`'s display text (see [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md#localizing-the-display-text--the-l10n-overlay-279)) |
| `lib/services/l10n/template_aware_state.dart` | A mixin: it refetches template-derived state in `didChangeDependencies` |
| `lib/services/l10n/app_language_reconcile.dart` | The three-way reconciliation with `LocaleManager` (Android 13+) |
| `lib/models/ui_msg.dart` | The sealed `UiMsg` — stored errors and statuses as typed values |
| `app/tool/l10n/` | Four CI checkers (`--strict` on every PR): ui_check, template_check, hardcoded_check, kotlin_check |
| `android … L10n.kt` | The native resolver: it reads `boxvpn_boot.app_language` and calls `createConfigurationContext` |

`MaterialApp.localizationsDelegates` carries only Flutter's built-in delegates
(the global Material/Widgets/Cupertino chrome); the app's own strings go through
`getLocalText` rather than a `Localizations` delegate.

**The language-switch pipeline** (every path that writes `app_language` — the picker, Debug,
a side-effect hook, a restore, or a system language change — converges here):
`LocaleController.set()` / `_applyLocale()`):

```
LocaleController.set(v)
  ├─ SettingsStorage.setAppLanguage(v)      # the JSON var (the truth) plus the MethodChannel mirror
  │     └─ native: the BootReceiver pref → resubmitting the notification channel →
  │        ServiceNotification.relabel → updateShortcuts (+onResume retry) →
  │        tile.requestListeningState → Libbox.setLocale → LocaleManager (33+)
  └─ _applyLocale(effective)
        ├─ _text = GetLocalText(dict<tag>, resolver<tag>)  # the new locale's natural-key dictionary
        ├─ await TemplateLoader.reload(tag)  # WARMED BEFORE notify (the cache is keyed by tag)
        ├─ RuleNameResolver.relocalize(...)  # the builder's display mirrors, with no rebuild
        ├─ LazyPersistFlush.flushAll()
        └─ notifyListeners()                 # a Listenable merged with themeNotifier → MaterialApp rebuilds
```

**The boundaries** (English forever): the logs, the Debug API responses, the
automation/Tasker payloads, `emitWarnings`, the wire values and tags, filenames,
user data, and the OS/core payloads (the `RawMsg.detail` passthrough). The units
(`B/KB/MB`, `Mbps`, `ms`) and the duration suffixes stay Latin in both locales.

---

## State Management

| Controller | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| `HomeController` | VPN lifecycle, CommandClient (groups/status/connections), nodes, ping (10 concurrent — `_pingConcurrency`), heartbeat, traffic, configChangedNeedRestart, autoUpdater wiring, haptic on transitions |
| `SubscriptionController` | CRUD entries (`sources[]` records), `refreshEntry`/persist, node-link registry calls on rename/move/delete (§439), `generateConfig` (no HTTP), `bindAutoUpdater`, init sweep (inProgress→failed). **§524** — `sourceEntries()` returns the WHOLE list (every genus, disk order); `applySourceOrder(keys)` writes the order ONCE, for keys of any genus |
| `ThemeNotifier` | Theme mode, SharedPreferences persistence |
| `HapticService` (singleton) | Event-based haptic with 100 ms throttle, respects system setting (spec 029) |
| `AutoUpdater` | Owned by HomeScreen; wraps SubscriptionController for 4-trigger auto-update with spam gates (spec 027) |

Pattern: `ChangeNotifier` + `AnimatedBuilder`. `HomeState` is immutable with `copyWith` (sentinel `_unset` for nullable fields).

`_needsRestart` in HomeScreen is a derived getter — returns `true` when `_subController.configDirty || (state.tunnelUp && state.configChangedNeedRestart)`. **§076 update**: `configDirty` branch is no longer gated on `tunnelUp` — settings-changed banner shows whenever there are pending changes, independent of tunnel state. Two banners mutually exclusive: blue «Settings changed» for `configDirty`, pink «Restart VPN» for `tunnelUp && configChangedNeedRestart && !configDirty`. Sticky until tunnel up↔down transition (see spec 003 §8a).

**§323/§324 update — the pink banner is no longer purely sticky.** Two things clear it early:

- **§323** — an identical rebuild (`changed == false`) *clears* the flag instead of preserving it. Rationale: if the saved config matches the previous one byte-for-byte, the running instance cannot be stale, regardless of flag history. A successful `reloadVpn()` also clears it (the core re-read the file, so running == saved).
- **§324** — a text diff answers "did the file change", not "is the running instance stale". When the diff says *changed* and the tunnel is up, the core is asked instead: `formatConfig(saved + OverrideOptions)` vs `runningConfigRaw` (§311 snapshot). Both sides pass through the same core parser+encoder (kernel SPEC 037 §3), so field order / `omitempty` / `[] → null` collapse **inside the core** — no client-side list of "differences to ignore". The verdict can only *clear* a false banner, never raise one; `unknown` (core unreachable, snapshot absent, old kernel) keeps the banner. See `services/config_staleness.dart` — it mirrors `OverrideOptions` because `formatConfig` does not apply them while the snapshot is post-override.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Native VPN service (no plugin) | flutter_singbox_vpn was unmaintained (0 stars), config in SharedPreferences |
| File-based config storage | Large JSON configs don't belong in SharedPreferences |
| serviceScope vs GlobalScope | Structured concurrency — coroutines die with service |
| libbox CommandClient for management (§122) | A server-stream push instead of Timer polling; the Clash HTTP API is gone |
| 10 concurrent mass pings (`_pingConcurrency`) | Sequential was too slow for 50+ nodes; the cap balances speed against load |
| SRS rules off by default | Require download, may fail offline |
| App list caching | getInstalledApps (~5s) called once, reused |
| profile-title from headers + content-disposition fallback | Auto-name subscriptions even without profile-title |
| URLTest hidden from dropdown | Users can't manually select in urltest — confusing UX |
| **Sealed `NodeSpec`** (Parser v2, v1.3.0) | Exhaustive switch at compile time; no runtime `type == 'vmess'` checks |
| **3-layer parser/builder** | Separation of concerns: parse ≠ build ≠ emit |
| **A server record stores only the source text** (`origin.raw`, §439; before — `raw_body`) | `nodes` is derivable via `parseAll(decode(raw))` on read; saves disk space, avoids NodeSpec serialization drift. The record's `tag` is written for the contract and not applied on read |
| **AutoUpdater gates** (spec 027) | `minRetryInterval=15min`, `maxFailsPerSession=5`, `_running`/`_inFlight` dedup — subscriptions never spam providers |
| **configChangedNeedRestart sticky flag** | Restart warning doesn't disappear on Stop-dialog cancel |
| **TLS-insecure → info severity** | Providers set it intentionally (REALITY, self-signed); shouldn't crowd out genuine warnings |
| **A shared `asBroadcastStream` for status events** (v1.4.0) | `BoxVpnClient.onStatusChanged` is cached as a `late final` |
| **A blocking `stopVPN` through a Completer** (v1.4.0) | The method channel waits for `setStatus(Stopped)` natively |
| **An intent-based sticky reset** (v1.4.0) | `configChangedNeedRestart=false` in `_stopInternal` and `_startInternal` |
| **`TunnelStatus.unknown`** (v1.4.0) | The default for an unknown raw value, instead of `disconnected` |
| **`ConfigCache` in HomeState** (v1.4.0; superseded by §091 → `ParsedConfig`) | The outbound JSON used to be parsed on every build |
| **`kDetourTagPrefix` as the single source of truth** (v1.4.0) | The `⚙ ` constant lives in `lib/config/consts.dart` |
| **Two persist patterns: lazy versus eager** (v1.9.0, §076) | Editing screens with a toggle-flood UX (`tun_apps_tab`) persist lazily |
| **A global `HomeReturnObserver`** (v1.9.0, §076) | A universal `NavigatorObserver` in `MaterialApp.navigatorObservers` |
| **An mtime-based bootstrap** (v1.9.0, §076; §113) | `ConfigDirtyCheck.isDirty()` compares the mtimes of `lxbox_settings.json` and the config |
| **The external `markConfigChangedNeedRestart` mark** (v1.9.0, §076) | A `HomeController` method for the settings screens |
| **Cohesion over line count, with `part`/`mixin` decomposition** (§089) | The monsters (home_screen and friends) were split by responsibility |
| **`ConfigNode` structural metadata instead of reverse-parsing the tag** (§091, implemented) | It removed a whole class of UI bugs |

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `http` | subscription fetch + rule-set/update/WARP HTTP requests |
| `json5` | JSON5/JSONC config parsing |
| `file_picker` | Config import from filesystem |
| `path_provider` | Documents directory for persistent storage |
| `shared_preferences` | Theme mode, haptic toggle |
| `share_plus` | Config/log export via system share sheet |
| **libbox** (native) | The sing-box core — the [`Leadaxe/sing-box-lx`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx) fork (`with_awg` + `with_xhttp`, §097/§104; §122 — no `with_clash_api`). The pin is `app/android/libbox.version` (the single source of truth; on a version bump check the file and `KERNEL.md`, not this line); the AAR is downloaded by `scripts/fetch-libbox.sh` from the fork's GH Releases (SHA256-verified) into a gitignored `libs/`. |

## Known limitations

### Config Editor — one-way pipeline (issue [#3](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/3))

The source of truth for every settings screen (Subscriptions, Routing, DNS, VPN settings, App settings).

```
state ──buildConfig──▶ configRaw ──save──▶ libbox
```

The Config Editor (`ConfigScreen.saveConfigRaw` → [`HomeController.saveConfigRaw`](../app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart)) writes the raw JSON.

- Manual edits to the JSON are invisible to the menu screens — the state knows nothing about them.
- Any change in the UI calls `buildConfig` over the state and overwrites the manual edits.
- The connection statistics do see the edits, because sing-box runs with that very config.

A full round trip would require a sing-box JSON → state parser covering everything.

## Feature Specs

The black-box feature catalogue lives in [`docs/spec/features/`](./spec/features/README.md):
one `NNN-NAME/FEATURE.md` per feature (purpose, promises, parameters, boundaries) plus
`FUNCTIONS/<function>.md` per user-facing function with its revision table. That folder
carries no code or platform detail and is the source of truth for *what* the app promises.

Implementation history lives in [`docs/spec/tasks/`](./spec/tasks/README.md). The specs
written before the Spec Kit (`NNN name/spec.md`) were moved there as `NNNF-name/` with the
`F` index (legacy index: [`F-INDEX.md`](./spec/tasks/F-INDEX.md)); each new feature lists
the legacy specs it absorbed in its header.

## Reusable layers (extraction targets)

LxBox is a monolith, but architecturally it holds several self-contained layers that could be extracted.

### Layer 1 — Sing-box VPN engine (Kotlin + Dart channel)

**What:** a native wrapper over libbox plus a Dart MethodChannel client. No UI and no opinions about the config.

| Files | Lines |
|---|---|
| `app/android/.../vpn/{BoxApplication, BoxVpnService, BoxService, PlatformInterfaceWrapper, VpnPlugin, ConfigManager, ServiceNotification, VpnStatus, DefaultNetworkMonitor, DefaultNetworkListener, LocalResolver, BootReceiver, Extensions}.kt` | ~3000 |
| `app/lib/vpn/box_vpn_client.dart` | ~600 |
| `app/lib/models/{tunnel_status, background_mode, app_info}.dart` | ~150 |

**The public API surface:** `BoxVpnClient.I` (see the [Dart `BoxVpnClient` API surface](#dart-boxvpnclient-api-surface) section).

**The coupling with LxBox (to be broken before extraction):**
- **The channel names are hardcoded** — `com.leadaxe.lxbox/methods`, `com.leadaxe.lxbox/status_events`, `lxbox/coreLog`.
- **The SharedPreferences keys are hardcoded** — `boxvpn_boot.{auto_start_vpn, keep_vpn_on_exit, background_mode, core_logs_enabled, …}`.
- **The notification icon and channel name** — `ServiceNotification.kt` references `R.drawable.ic_notification`.
- **The manifest declarations** — the package must **document** the permissions it requires.
- **`WifiNetworkObserver` depends on the Dart-side `wifi_history` MethodChannel** — that is an LxBox feature (§051).

**The quality gates have been passed:** the §049 audit (atomic CAS, the F1 split, the F2–F26 fixes) and the §050 closeout.

**iOS:** absent. A cross-platform package would be a separate task (a Network Extension).

### Layer 2 — CommandClient channel

**What:** the libbox `CommandClient` control channel (§122) — the native `BoxCommandClient.kt` plus the Dart `CcChannel`.

| Files | Lines |
|---|---|
| `app/android/.../BoxCommandClient.kt` | ~native |
| `app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart` | ~700 |

**The coupling with LxBox:** **medium**. The Dart side is generic (push streams plus unary RPC over an EventChannel).

**The API surface:** see the [CommandClient (libbox)](#commandclient-libbox) section — status/outbounds/groups/connections.

**Readiness for extraction:** **medium**. It travels with Layer 1 (a shared native component).

### Layer 3 — Sing-box subscription parser / builder

**What:** the sealed `NodeSpec` (11 protocol variants, including Masque §130) plus the URI/JSON/INI parsers and the builder.

| Files | Lines |
|---|---|
| `app/lib/models/{node_spec, node_spec_emit, tls_spec, transport_spec, ...}.dart` | ~2000 |
| `app/lib/services/parser/*.dart` | ~1500 |
| `app/lib/services/builder/*.dart` | ~2000 |

**The coupling with LxBox:** **high**. The builder depends on the shape of `wizard_template.json` (our own format).

**Readiness for extraction:** **low**. It would need a serious refactor to separate the parser from the builder.

### Layer 4 — TrafficProfiler

**What:** a per-app and system-wide observer of DNS/TCP/UDP events.

**The coupling:** **high** — see the coupling notes in [section 6.5](#65-traffic-profiler-044--048).

**Readiness:** low. It only makes sense once the LxBox VPN engine has been extracted.

### The extraction roadmap (should we decide to go)

1. **Phase 1** — the sing-box VPN engine plus the CommandClient channel (Layers 1 and 2) into `packages/flutter_singbox/`.
2. **Phase 2** — extract a reusable `NodeSpec` parser/emit from Layer 3 (without the builder pipeline).
3. **Phase 3** — the publication decision: libbox's viral GPLv3 is the main blocker.
4. **Phase 4** — iOS support (if it is wanted).

**The current status:** nothing has been extracted. The VPN engine (Layer 1) and the CommandClient channel (Layer 2) are the closest candidates.
