# Protocol Documentation

L×Box parses proxy URIs from subscriptions and converts them into [sing-box](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/) outbound (or endpoint) JSON. This document describes every supported protocol, its URI format, parsed parameters, and the resulting sing-box configuration.

**Source code (Parser v2, spec 026):**
- [`app/lib/services/parser/uri_parsers.dart`](../app/lib/services/parser/uri_parsers.dart) — the scheme dispatcher. The **set of schemes comes from the registry**, not from literals in the code (§512): it is the union of `detect.scheme_in` over every `mappers.uri` section in [`app/contract/registry/protocols/*.json`](../app/contract/registry/protocols), so a spelling that arrives with a contract works without a code change — `amneziawg://` (contract 1.1.48) was the first such case. Covered today: vless, vmess, trojan, shadowsocks, hysteria2, naive, tuic, ssh, socks, http, anytls, wireguard/awg/amneziawg, masque
- [`app/lib/services/parser/transport.dart`](../app/lib/services/parser/transport.dart) — parsing `TransportSpec`, native XHTTP (§097, the full parameter set in §127)
- [`app/lib/services/parser/json_parsers.dart`](../app/lib/services/parser/json_parsers.dart) — `parseSingboxEntry`, `parseXrayOutbound`
- [`app/lib/services/parser/ini_parser.dart`](../app/lib/services/parser/ini_parser.dart) — WireGuard INI
- [`app/lib/services/parser/parse_all.dart`](../app/lib/services/parser/parse_all.dart) — orchestrator
- [`app/lib/models/node_spec.dart`](../app/lib/models/node_spec.dart), [`node_spec_emit.dart`](../app/lib/models/node_spec_emit.dart) — sealed `NodeSpec` + `emit()` / `toUri()`. `toUri()` is **not** implemented per variant: every variant delegates to `uriViaEngineRequired`, which writes the link through the section engine (the emit rules live in the registry). Tailscale is the one exception — `toUriTailscale`, because the node has no link form of its own
- `openvpn-client` (task 586, contract 1.1.99): a registry type without described fields (`body.fields_unchecked`). It is pasted as sing-box JSON only — no form, no `.ovpn` import, no links. Accepted from any source (own record, a document with other types, a subscription) as `UnknownTypeSpec` without warnings; the body goes to the core as written, into `endpoints[]`. On a core without `with_openvpn` the build drops it with `openvpn_core_unsupported`
- Config section of every type — the `kind` of its registry record (`ContractRegistry.isEndpointType`); the app keeps no list of endpoint types (task 586)
- Types outside the registry (e.g. `future-proto`): accepted only from an own source (own server, folder member, node editor) as `UnknownTypeSpec` with an info warning «Unknown node type»; the body goes to the core as written, into `outbounds[]`; in a subscription such an entry is still dropped (task 585)

**Sanitisers and guards.** Every place where a value is dropped, normalised,
defaulted or degraded so the core does not fail — the full registry with
`file:line` for each guard — is [`GUARDS.md`](GUARDS.md). This document
describes what the fields *mean*; that one describes what happens when a
provider sends something the core will not take.

**Shared contract with the desktop launcher (SPEC 103).** The normative field
reference lives outside this repo and is vendored into `app/contract/` by
[`app/tool/sync_contract.sh`](../app/tool/sync_contract.sh) (pinned in
`app/contract.lock`):

- `contract/registry/protocols/<scheme>.json` — per-scheme query parameters,
  aliases, allowlists and degradation rules. Where this document and the
  registry disagree, the registry wins.
- `contract/docs/PARSING_PRINCIPLES.md`, `IDENTITY.md` — how a parsed node is canonicalized
  and how its identity hash is computed. Both projects must agree, otherwise the
  same subscription yields different nodes on phone and desktop.
- `contract/corpus/uri/` — conformance fixtures run by
  [`app/test/contract/contract_test.dart`](../app/test/contract/contract_test.dart)
  here and by `core/config/contract_test.go` in the launcher. A parser change
  that alters behaviour shows up as a corpus diff.

## 0. Subscription HTTP Headers

When fetching a subscription URL, L×Box reads several **de facto standard** HTTP response headers. These are **not formally standardized** (no RFC), but the convention is universally adopted across V2Ray/Clash/sing-box client ecosystem since ~2019. Backends like [V2Board](https://github.com/v2board/v2board), [Xboard](https://github.com/cedar2025/Xboard), [Marzban](https://github.com/Gozargah/Marzban) emit them out of the box.

### Parsed Headers

| Header | Format | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `subscription-userinfo` | `upload=N; download=N; total=N; expire=UNIX` | Traffic quota and expiry |
| `profile-title` | plain text or **base64-encoded UTF-8** | Display name for subscription |
| `profile-update-interval` | integer hours | Auto-refresh interval hint |
| `support-url` | URL (often `https://t.me/...`) | Link to provider support |
| `profile-web-page-url` | URL | Provider's website |
| `content-disposition` | `attachment; filename="..."` | Fallback for title |

### Example Response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
subscription-userinfo: upload=12345678; download=987654321; total=107374182400; expire=1735689600
profile-title: My VPN Provider
profile-update-interval: 24
support-url: https://t.me/myvpn_support
profile-web-page-url: https://myvpn.com

vless://uuid@server1.example.com:443?...
vless://uuid@server2.example.com:443?...
...
```

### Where They Come From

| Client | Role |
|--------|------|
| [v2rayN](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN) (2018) | First to parse `subscription-userinfo` |
| [Clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash) (2020) | Formalized header list in [Clash Wiki](https://clash.wiki/configuration/subscription-userinfo) |
| [Clash.Meta / Mihomo](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo) | Extended with additional fields |
| [subconverter](https://github.com/tindy2013/subconverter) | De facto reference converter — reads/writes all headers |
| [Hiddify](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-next) | Full set support |

### Traffic Quota Display

The `subscription-userinfo` header drives the **traffic quota bar** in subscription detail:

```
Used:     1.05 GB uploaded + 920 MB downloaded = 1.97 GB / 100 GB
Expires:  2026-12-31 (8 months remaining)
```

Backend reference: any of V2Board, Xboard, Marzban panels. These are PHP/Go backends that generate subscription responses with correct headers automatically — provider admins don't need to configure them manually.

### Why No RFC

This is **cargo cult convention** — works because all clients parse identically. Similar to how `X-Forwarded-For` was de facto standard for ~10 years before [RFC 7239](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7239). If a new client introduced its own header, no provider would emit it, so the ecosystem stays consistent through inertia.

### Implementation in L×Box

Parsing lives in [`app/lib/services/subscription/sources.dart`](../app/lib/services/subscription/sources.dart) (`_metaFromHeaders` plus `_parseContentDispositionFilename`). After a fetch the headers become a `SubscriptionMeta` and are stored in `SubscriptionServers.meta`:

- `SubscriptionServers.name` ← `profile-title` (falling back to `content-disposition: filename=...`, v1.3.0+)
- `SubscriptionMeta.{totalBytes, uploadBytes, downloadBytes, expireTimestamp}` ← `subscription-userinfo`
- `SubscriptionMeta.supportUrl` ← `support-url`
- `SubscriptionMeta.webPageUrl` ← `profile-web-page-url`
- `SubscriptionServers.updateIntervalHours` ← `profile-update-interval` (used by [spec 027](./spec/tasks/027F-subscription-auto-update/spec.md))

The User-Agent of HTTP requests is `LxBox-android/<appVersion>` (for example `LxBox-android/2.9.0`; the brand token since §114, previously `LxBox Android subscription client` / `SubscriptionParserClient`). It can be overridden per request through App Settings → Subscriptions → Custom User-Agent (§118). Panels route the response body by the `LxBox` substring in the UA (`user_agent.dart`, `resolveSubscriptionUserAgent`).

Displayed in the subscription detail → **Source tab** → Headers section.

## 1. VLESS

### URI Format

```
vless://UUID@host:port?query_params#label
```

### Parsed Parameters

| Parameter | Query key | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| UUID | (userinfo) | User ID |
| Flow | `flow` | XTLS flow control (`xtls-rprx-vision`, `xtls-rprx-vision-udp443`) |
| Security | `security` | `tls`, `reality`, or `none` |
| SNI | `sni` or `peer` | TLS server name |
| Fingerprint | `fp` or `fingerprint` | UTLS fingerprint (defaults to `random`) |
| ALPN | `alpn` | Comma-separated ALPN values |
| Public key | `pbk` | The REALITY public key. REALITY is enabled only for a valid X25519 key (base64/base64url → exactly 32 bytes after decode); garbage falls back to plain TLS and now carries the `reality_pbk_invalid` code on every input — URI, sing-box JSON, Xray JSON (§169, code added in §464) |
| Short ID | `sid` | REALITY short ID (hex, max 16 chars) |
| REALITY key share | `key_share` | `hybrid` \| `classical` (sing-box `tls.reality.key_share`, §457). Read only together with a valid `pbk`; anything outside the enum is dropped silently — the core rejects an unknown value along with the whole config. Requires the core pin `v1.14.1-lx.4` or newer |
| Transport type | `type` | `tcp`, `ws`, `grpc`, `http`, `httpupgrade`, `xhttp` (`splithttp` is the same thing under its older Xray name, §463), `raw` |
| Path | `path` | WebSocket/HTTP/HTTPUpgrade path |
| Host | `host` | WebSocket Host header / HTTP host |
| Service name | `serviceName` or `service_name` | gRPC service name, passed to the core **verbatim** (§468, contract 1.1.3, core `v1.14.1-lx.8`+). A leading `/` makes the value a ready-made request path in Xray's absolute-path notation: the core escapes it segment by segment, reads the last segment as the *stream* name and drops a `\|…` tail, so `/a/b/Tun` reaches the wire as `/a/b/Tun` and `/a/Stream` as `/a/Stream`. Without a leading `/` it is a service name — one escaped segment plus the core's own `/Tun` (`a/b` → `/a%2Fb/Tun`). The §464 translation `/<service>/Tun` → `<service>` was removed with the lx.8 pin: it only ever fixed the single-segment form and would now strip a `/` the core expects. Note that the URI parser percent-decodes `serviceName`, so a `%2F` inside a segment becomes a separator after parsing — exactly as in Xray |
| Header type | `headerType` | **Drops the node** with `transport_header_unsupported` when it names real obfuscation (§514, contract 1.1.52, D133-58). Until 1.1.52 the value became `transport.type: "http"`, which is a *wrong* mapping, not an approximate one: sing-box `http` is the HTTP/2 transport — a different protocol on the wire — while Xray's camouflage keeps the transport as TCP and only fakes the first packet. A server expecting camouflage received an h2 handshake and closed the connection: the node looked healthy and never worked. `none` and empty mean *no* camouflage and are silent |
| Packet encoding | `packetEncoding` (case-insensitive) | An allow-list of `xudp` / `packetaddr`. The xray-style `none`, and any garbage, is dropped silently — sing-box `NewOutbound` accepts only those two values, and anything else panics inside libbox. |
| Encryption | `encryption` | The post-quantum layer (§335, core SPEC 032). Its **shape** is checked against the registry, and a value that fails **drops the node** (§477, contract 1.1.9) — see the note below. |
| Insecure | `insecure`, `allowInsecure` | Skip certificate verification |

### sing-box Outbound Mapping

```json
{
  "type": "vless",
  "tag": "<label>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "uuid": "<UUID>",
  "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision",
  "tls": {
    "enabled": true,
    "server_name": "<sni>",
    "utls": { "enabled": true, "fingerprint": "<fp>" },
    "reality": {
      "enabled": true,
      "public_key": "<pbk>",
      "short_id": "<sid>"
    },
    "alpn": ["h2", "http/1.1"],
    "insecure": false
  },
  "transport": {
    "type": "ws",
    "path": "/path",
    "headers": { "Host": "<host>" }
  }
}
```

### Transport Options

| Type | Query `type=` | sing-box transport |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| TCP (raw) | `tcp`, `raw`, empty | No transport block |
| TCP + HTTP headers | `tcp`/`raw` + `headerType=http` | **No node** — dropped with `transport_header_unsupported` (§514). The Xray JSON spellings `tcpSettings.header.type` and `rawSettings.header.type` behave identically; before 1.1.52 that form was lost in complete silence and the node was assembled as plain TCP |
| WebSocket | `ws` | `{"type": "ws", "path": ..., "headers": {"Host": ...}}` — a `?ed=N` in the path becomes `max_early_data` (§303, see the note below) |
| gRPC | `grpc` | `{"type": "grpc", "service_name": ...}` |
| HTTP/2 | `http` | `{"type": "http", "path": ..., "host": [...]}` |
| HTTPUpgrade | `httpupgrade` | `{"type": "httpupgrade", "path": ..., "host": ...}` |
| XHTTP | `xhttp` | `{"type": "xhttp", "path": ..., "host": ..., "mode": ...}` — native since §097, see [XHTTP transport](#xhttp-transport) |

> **Note on WebSocket early data (§303).** Xray specifies early data as a tail on the path — `"path": "/api/v2/channel?ed=2560"`. In sing-box that is a separate transport field, and a tail left in `path` goes into the HTTP request and produces a `404`. On import (from a URI, Xray JSON or sing-box JSON) the tail is stripped and `ed=N` becomes `max_early_data: N`. The header name is **not** filled in: an empty `early_data_header_name` means the core sends early data in the path (`transport/v2raywebsocket/conn.go`), exactly as Xray does for `?ed=`; filling in `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` would switch to header-based mode and break compatibility with the server. An explicit `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` in `wsSettings.headers` is still read as an ordinary header. `httpupgrade` has no such transport field, so the tail is stripped and `ed` is discarded. Emitting back to a URI glues `path?ed=N` together again so the round trip does not lose the parameter.
>
> **A second form — flat `ed`/`eh` (§320).** Some generators put the same parameters in separate keys: `?ed=2560&eh=Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` (in Xray JSON, `wsSettings.ed` / `.eh`). Here `eh` is given **explicitly**, meaning the provider is asking for header mode, so `early_data_header_name` is emitted — without it the core would append base64 to the path while the server waited for it in a header (`404`). A path tail takes priority over a flat `ed`: it addresses one specific path rather than the whole link. An `eh` with no `ed` is ignored — early data mode is enabled by `max_early_data > 0`, and a header name without a size means nothing. For `httpupgrade` the flat `ed`/`eh` are not read at all.
>
> **Double percent-encoding of the path (§320).** Aggregators hand out `path=%2F%252Fassignment`: `Uri.queryParameters` decodes exactly once, so `/%2Fassignment` used to reach the config instead of `//assignment`. The remainder is unwrapped (up to two passes) **before** the `?ed=` tail is stripped, otherwise a doubly-encoded `%253Fed%253D2560` is not recognised. The path itself is not validated — emoji, `//` and `@` are all legal, and the core prepends a leading slash itself when one is missing (`client.go`).

> **Note on XHTTP.** Since §097 (the core is the [`sing-box-lx`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx) fork with the `with_xhttp` build tag) XHTTP is emitted **natively**: `{"type": "xhttp", ...}` with no substitution of the wire protocol. The former fallback to `httpupgrade` with an `UnsupportedTransportWarning` (Parser v2, up to and including v1.8.2) has been removed. The XHTTP-specific query keys are `mode`, `xPaddingBytes`/`x_padding_bytes` and `noGRPCHeader`/`no_grpc_header` (camelCase is the Xray URI form, snake_case is sing-box). It is incompatible with `flow=xtls-rprx-vision` — Vision only lives on bare TCP. Details: [XHTTP transport](#xhttp-transport).

### TLS Behavior

- If `pbk` is present **and is a valid X25519 public key** (base64/base64url, decodes to exactly 32 bytes): REALITY TLS is enabled. An invalid `pbk` (e.g. `pbk=enabled`/`true` from broken subscriptions — both are legal base64, 5 and 3 bytes long, which is why the length is counted *after* the decode) falls back to **plain TLS** with the `reality_pbk_invalid` code instead of emitting a REALITY block the core rejects — before §169 one broken node used to poison the whole `config.json` at startup. §464 made the code appear on all three inputs: the URI branch used to degrade silently while the JSON import reported it, so the same node arriving two ways carried two different code sets.
- **REALITY `key_share` (§457, core `v1.14.1-lx.4`+).** `tls.reality.key_share` picks the key share of the REALITY ClientHello: `hybrid` demands `X25519MLKEM768` (~1.5–1.9 KB, two TCP segments — what Xray ≥ v26.9.8 requires), `classical` strips the hybrid out of `key_share` and `supported_groups` (~0.5 KB, one segment — for older servers and networks that drop the large hello). Absent means whatever the fingerprint carries. It arrives from sing-box JSON (`tls.reality.key_share`) and from the share URI (`key_share=`, the same name as the core key, §453); in the URI it is read only when the REALITY block is actually built, i.e. `pbk` is a valid X25519 key. Any value outside `{hybrid, classical}` — including a different case such as `Hybrid`, a number, or an empty string — is **dropped silently**, and the node stays alive: the core answers an unknown value with `unknown reality key_share` and refuses to create the outbound, which takes the whole config down. This is not `reality_fp_not_chrome` (§451): that warning is about the fingerprint, not about `key_share`, and its logic is untouched.
- `flow` is **never** auto-derived from REALITY (§115): it is taken verbatim from the link. Historically bare-TCP+REALITY without `flow` got a forced Vision, breaking valid `none` setups.
- `xtls-rprx-vision` is valid only on bare TLS. If a transport (ws/grpc/xhttp/http/httpupgrade) is present, the explicit `flow` is dropped with the registry code `vision_with_transport` (`protocols/vless.json` → `flow`, `conflicts`), which carries the path and the value; the core would not bring up that combination. `emit()` writes `flow` only when it is exactly `xtls-rprx-vision` with no transport.
- If `security=none`: no TLS block.
- If port is a known plaintext port (80, 8080, 8880, 2052, 2082, 2086, 2095) and no explicit security: no TLS.
- Otherwise: TLS enabled with UTLS fingerprint (defaults to `random`).
- Special flow `xtls-rprx-vision-udp443`: normalized to `xtls-rprx-vision` + `packet_encoding: xudp`. **The node's port is not touched** on any path — URI, sing-box JSON or Xray JSON. Until §459 the Xray-JSON branch forced `server_port: 443`, which made a `…:8443` node unreachable; the port is a property of the node, not of the flow (contract §24.2 item 7.4).

### packet_encoding allow-list

sing-box `vless.NewOutbound` accepts exactly three forms (see the [docs](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/configuration/outbound/vless/)):

| Value in the URI | In the outbound JSON | Meaning |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| omitted, `""`, `none` | the field is not emitted | the sing-box default |
| `xudp` / `XUDP` / `Xudp` | `"packet_encoding": "xudp"` | XUDP wrapper (xray) |
| `packetaddr` / `PacketAddr` | `"packet_encoding": "packetaddr"` | packet-addr (v2ray 5+) |
| anything else | the field is not emitted, plus a warning in the log | protection against a libbox panic |

Xray-style subscriptions (xray-knife and others) put `packetEncoding=none` there meaning “no encoding”. sing-box does not understand that string and panics inside `format.ToString` while trying to report the error (`E.New` receives a `*string` pointer instead of a dereferenced string — an upstream bug). L×Box filters on input against the allow-list so that no invalid value ever leaves the app.

### encryption — shape and order of processing

The post-quantum layer is a **closed grammar** in the core, not a free string,
and a value the grammar rejects brings down the start of the **entire config**
— one bad line in one node of a subscription and the VPN comes up on no node at
all ([#147](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/147)).

The app checks the **shape only**, by one rule in the registry
(`vless.body.fields.encryption`, contract 1.1.9):

`^mlkem768x25519plus(\.[^.]+){3,}$` — case-sensitive.

The grammar itself is deliberately **not** duplicated: a copy would drift from
the core at the next pin bump and start rejecting *working* nodes, which costs
more than it catches. Anything finer than the shape is left to the core.

The order is normative and identical on every input — link, sing-box body and
(after step 8 of spec 472) Xray JSON:

1. the link mapper URL-decodes the parameter;
2. whitespace is trimmed **from both ends of the whole string**, silently, with
   no code — the core does the same (`strings.TrimSpace`). The **trimmed** value
   is what goes into the body;
3. the result being empty or exactly `none` means the layer is off: the field is
   not written and there is no code. The comparison is **exact** — the core
   matches its own literal case-sensitively, so `None` is a real value to it,
   and hiding it as an off-switch would let a node that kills the whole config
   through;
4. otherwise the value must match the pattern. It does not → the **node is
   dropped**, code `vless_encryption_invalid` (error), with the field path and
   the **raw** value, before trimming.

Spaces **inside** segments are legal on purpose: the core trims segments from
the fourth onwards, so `….0rtt. KEY` is a good value and travels as is.

Dropping the node rather than the field is the point: a node with no
`encryption` will not connect to a server that requires the layer anyway, and
quietly removing encryption would be a silent downgrade of protection.

The method name is the only thing judged by content, and it is baked into the
expression — see `docs/KERNEL.md` for the check to run when the core pin moves.

## 2. VMess

### URI Format (v2rayN)

```
vmess://BASE64_JSON#label
```

The base64 payload decodes to a JSON object:

```json
{
  "v": "2",
  "ps": "node name",
  "add": "server.com",
  "port": 443,
  "id": "uuid",
  "aid": 0,
  "scy": "auto",
  "net": "ws",
  "type": "none",
  "host": "example.com",
  "path": "/path",
  "tls": "tls",
  "sni": "example.com",
  "alpn": "h2,http/1.1",
  "fp": "chrome"
}
```

### Legacy Format

```
vmess://BASE64(method:uuid@host:port)#label
```

Decoded as `method:uuid@host:port`. The method is normalized to a sing-box VMess security value.

### Parsed Parameters

| Field | JSON key | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Server | `add` | Server address |
| Port | `port` | Server port |
| UUID | `id` | User ID |
| Name | `ps` | Display name |
| Security | `scy` or `security` | Encryption method. Enum of the core (`sing-vmess` `client.go:42-54`): `auto`, `none`, `zero`, `aes-128-cfb`, `aes-128-gcm`, `chacha20-poly1305`. Normalised with `trim`+`lower`; `chacha20-ietf-poly1305` is an alias for `chacha20-poly1305`; empty/`null`/`undefined` and anything outside the set (including `aes-128-ctr`) become `auto` — the core answers an unknown method with a fatal on the **whole** config. The same funnel serves the URI, sing-box JSON and Xray JSON (§459) |
| Alter ID | `aid` | Alter ID (0 for AEAD) |
| Network | `net` | Transport type |
| Path | `path` | Transport path |
| Host | `host` | Transport host |
| TLS | `tls` | `"tls"` to enable TLS |
| SNI | `sni` | TLS server name |
| ALPN | `alpn` | Comma-separated ALPN |
| Fingerprint | `fp` | UTLS fingerprint |
| Insecure | `insecure` | `"1"` to skip cert verify |

### Security Normalization

| Input | Normalized |
|-------|-----------|
| empty, `null`, `undefined` | `auto` |
| `chacha20-ietf-poly1305` | `chacha20-poly1305` |
| `auto`, `none`, `zero`, `aes-128-gcm`, `chacha20-poly1305`, `aes-128-ctr` | as-is |
| anything else | `auto` |

### Transport Mapping

| `net` value | sing-box transport |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `tcp` or empty | No transport |

## 4. Shadowsocks

### URI Formats

**SIP002 (modern):**
```
ss://BASE64(method:password)@host:port#label
```

**Legacy:**
```
ss://BASE64(method:password@host:port)#label
```

Both formats are auto-detected. The base64 part before `@` is decoded first; if it contains `method:password` and the method is valid, SIP002 format is used. Otherwise the entire base64 is decoded as legacy format.

### Supported Methods

The set is the core's own 18 methods (`sing-shadowsocks2 v0.2.1`
`method_registry`); anything outside it is a `CreateMethod` error on the whole
config, so such a node is dropped.

AEAD (recommended):

- `2022-blake3-aes-128-gcm`
- `2022-blake3-aes-256-gcm`
- `2022-blake3-chacha20-poly1305`
- `none`
- `aes-128-gcm`
- `aes-192-gcm`
- `aes-256-gcm`
- `chacha20-ietf-poly1305`
- `xchacha20-ietf-poly1305`

Legacy stream ciphers (accepted since §463; the node lives and carries the
info code `ss_method_legacy`). They predate AEAD, so the traffic is encrypted
but **not authenticated** — an attacker in the path can alter it undetected.
They are accepted because the core accepts them and because dropping a working
node without explanation is worse: the user simply saw nodes disappear from the
subscription.

- `aes-128-ctr`, `aes-192-ctr`, `aes-256-ctr`
- `aes-128-cfb`, `aes-192-cfb`, `aes-256-cfb`
- `rc4-md5`
- `chacha20-ietf`
- `xchacha20`

### SIP003 Plugins

The SIP002 URI query carries the SIP003 plugin:

| Query key | Format | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `plugin` | `name;k=v;k=v…` | The plugin name (up to the first `;`) plus its options (`obfs-local`, `v2ray-plugin`, …) |
| `plugin_opts` | `k=v;k=v…` | The options on their own, when not passed inside `plugin` |

### sing-box Outbound Mapping

```json
{
  "type": "shadowsocks",
  "tag": "<label>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "method": "<method>",
  "password": "<password>",
  "plugin": "obfs-local",
  "plugin_opts": "obfs=http;obfs-host=example.com"
}
```

### Notes

- Shadowsocks handles its own encryption; TLS is not applicable. Transport obfuscation is only possible through a SIP003 plugin (`plugin`/`plugin_opts` above) — those are emitted into the outbound when set.
- Unsupported methods cause a parse error (node is skipped).
- Base64 decoding tries both standard and URL-safe variants, with and without padding.
- Round-trip: `plugin`/`plugin_opts` are emitted into the sing-box JSON, but the share URI (`toUri`) does **not** write them — exporting to `ss://` loses the plugin.

## 5. Hysteria2

### URI Format

```
hysteria2://password@host:port?query_params#label
hy2://password@host:port?query_params#label
```

Both `hysteria2://` and `hy2://` schemes are supported (the latter is normalized to the former).

### Parsed Parameters

| Parameter | Query key | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Password | userinfo | Authentication password |
| SNI | `sni` | TLS server name |
| Insecure | `insecure`, `allowInsecure`, `skip-cert-verify` | Skip cert verify |
| Fingerprint | `fp` or `fingerprint` | UTLS fingerprint |
| ALPN | `alpn` | Comma-separated ALPN |
| Obfuscation | `obfs` | Obfuscation type (only `salamander` supported) |
| Obfs password | `obfs-password` | Salamander obfuscation password |
| Up bandwidth | `up_mbps` | Bandwidth hint, Mbps (int, optional; §084) |
| Down bandwidth | `down_mbps` | Bandwidth hint, Mbps (int, optional; §084) |

### sing-box Outbound Mapping

```json
{
  "type": "hysteria2",
  "tag": "<label>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "password": "<password>",
  "up_mbps": 100,
  "down_mbps": 100,
  "obfs": {
    "type": "salamander",
    "password": "<obfs-password>"
  },
  "tls": {
    "enabled": true,
    "server_name": "<sni>",
    "insecure": false,
    "alpn": ["h3"]
  }
}
```

No `utls` and no `reality` — see "TLS over QUIC" below. The mapping table above
used to show a `utls` block; it never reached the config.

### TLS over QUIC (§469, contract 1.1.4)

Hysteria2 runs over QUIC, and the core builds QUIC's TLS through the standard
engine (`aTLS.Config.STDConfig()`). Neither a uTLS fingerprint nor REALITY can
be provided that way — `STDConfig()` on those configs returns an error and the
outbound does not start at all. So `tls.utls` and `tls.reality` are stripped
whole, and `fp=`/`pbk=`/`sid=` in a link have no effect on the connection.

The same holds for **tuic**, **masque** and **hysteria v1**: one rule, four
schemes, stated once in the contract registry (`tls.json`,
`body.fields.utls/reality` → `forbidden_for` + `forbidden_codes`).

Since 1.1.4 the strip is no longer silent: the node gets
`tls_not_applicable_quic` (severity `info` — the setting would not have applied
anyway, so nothing is lost), **one code per block**. A stripped REALITY counts
as one: `short_id` and `key_share` inside it produce no codes of their own.
The node's body is unchanged by this — the blocks never reached the config.

Everything else in the TLS block is fine over QUIC and is kept:
`server_name`, `alpn`, `insecure`, `certificate_public_key_sha256` (the
`pinSHA256=` pin), certificates and TLS versions.

### Notes

- TLS is always enabled (Hysteria2 runs over QUIC).
- Port hopping (`mport`/`ports` → `server_ports`) **is** implemented (§103 §9.B2). Both query spellings are read, and so is a multi-port authority (`host:443,20000-30000`), which `Uri.parse` cannot digest at all — the engine's own lexer splits it and the `$multiport` entry prepends the ranges. The core's form uses a **colon** (`"low:high"`); the dash a link is written with would be a `bad port range` fatal over the whole config, and a single port becomes the pair `N:N`. An element that is not a pair of numbers is dropped outright: a rebuilt authority (`host:443`) used to travel through as-is and take the whole VPN down with it, and its single port belongs to `server_port`, not to the ranges. Registry: `protocols/hysteria2.json` → `mappers.uri.params.mport` / `$multiport` (`normalize: port_range_spec`).
- `up_mbps`/`down_mbps` are parsed and round-tripped (URI/JSON), emitted only when present. Both URI spellings are read — `upmbps`/`downmbps` **and** `up_mbps`/`down_mbps` (registry aliases, §464); emission keeps the canonical `upmbps`/`downmbps`.
- `obfs-min-packet-size`/`obfs-max-packet-size` are gecko-only. With `obfs=salamander` they are dropped with `field_requires` instead of disappearing silently (§464, registry `requires` + `equals`).
- Invalid SNI values (e.g. emoji-only) are replaced with the server address.

## 5.5 NaïveProxy

### URI Format

```
naive+https://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/?<params>#<label>
```

Following the [DuckSoft 2020 de-facto specification](https://gist.github.com/DuckSoft/ca03913b0a26fc77a1da4d01cc6ab2f1) (used by NekoBox, NaiveGUI, v2rayN, Hiddify).

| Component | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `host` | Server address (FQDN or IP, IPv6 in brackets) | required |
| `port` | TCP port | `443` |
| userinfo: `user:pass` | HTTP Basic credentials | optional |
| userinfo: `pass` (no colon) | Treated as **password-only** auth — username stays empty (§465) | optional |
| userinfo: `user:` (trailing colon) | Username only, empty password | optional |
| Query: `extra-headers=<urlencoded>` | `Header1: Value1\r\nHeader2: Value2` after URL-decoding (`\r\n` → `%0D%0A`, `:` → `%3A`) | empty |
| Query: `padding=true\|false` | **Ignored with log warning** — no sing-box equivalent | n/a |
| Fragment `#label` | Display name (UTF-8, URL-decoded) | derived from `host:port` |

### Examples

```
naive+https://user:pass@server.example.com:443/?padding=false#JP-01
naive+https://server.example.com:8443                                      # anonymous
naive+https://onlypass@server.example.com                                  # password-only
naive+https://onlyuser:@server.example.com                                 # username-only
naive+https://u:p@host?extra-headers=X-User%3Aalice%0D%0AX-Token%3Axyz
naive+https://u:p@host:443/?extra-headers=X-Forwarded-Proto%3Ahttps#%E2%9C%85%20DE
```

### Generated sing-box Outbound

```json
{
  "type": "naive",
  "tag": "<label or naive-host-port>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "username": "<user>",
  "password": "<pass>",
  "extra_headers": { "Header": "Value" },
  "tls": { "enabled": true, "server_name": "<host>" }
}
```

### Behaviour Notes

- TLS is **always** enabled — `tls.enabled = true`, `tls.server_name = host`. NaïveProxy without TLS is meaningless.
- An **empty host rejects the node** (§463, contract §24.6). Up to that point `naive+https://` stayed a live node with `server: ""`, on the premise that the Go side only validates a non-empty hostname for vless/trojan/ssh/tuic/anytls. The premise was wrong: the core answers an empty server address with a fatal for the *whole* config (`invalid server address`), so a single such node in a subscription left the user with no VPN at all.
- The naive outbound in sing-box rejects `alpn`, `insecure`, `disable_sni`, `utls`, `reality`, `min/max_version`, `cipher_suites`, `curve_preferences`, `client_*`, `fragment`, `kernel_*`. The parser deliberately leaves them unset. What naive **does** accept on top of `enabled`/`server_name` is `certificate` (PEM, string or array — its own trusted root, fed to cronet) and `certificate_path`; both survive the JSON round-trip since §454 (issue #140). The pin `certificate_public_key_sha256` is silently ignored by naive and therefore dropped.
- `network`/`udp_over_tcp`/`quic` fields are **not** emitted in v1 — the URI standard does not carry them and naive QUIC mode is deferred (see spec 037 §10).
- **A single userinfo without a colon is the password**, not the username (§465, contract §24.2 item 7.3). Until then the rule was the opposite (SPEC 103 item 6, mirroring Go's `url.User.Username()`), and it contradicted every emitter in sight: NekoBox, NaiveGUI and the Go share-URI writer all put the password in that slot, as does this app's own link writer (the naive `emit` rules of the registry section; a separate `toUriNaive` no longer exists) — so a link the app handed out came back with the password read as a login, and the node authenticated with none. The colon is what tells the two apart: `pass@host` is password-only, `user:@host` is username-only, `user:pass@host` is both. The emitter keeps that colon for the username-only form, so `parseUri(spec.toUri())` returns the same credentials for all three.
- `extra_headers` keys are sorted lexicographically when emitted to JSON or back to URI form, for deterministic round-trip.
- `padding` is silently dropped because sing-box has no corresponding option.

### Build-tag Requirement

NaïveProxy outbound is gated behind the sing-box build tag `with_naive_outbound`. Since §097/§104 L×Box bundles its own fork core `sing-box-lx` (local `app/android/libbox.aar`, pin in [`app/android/libbox.version`](../app/android/libbox.version); the old Maven `com.github.singbox-android:libbox` dependency is gone), built **with** this tag — see [spec 037 §2](spec/tasks/037F-naive-proxy/spec.md#2-build-tag-в-libbox--проверено) for verification details. If a future core build ever ships without naive, `BoxVpnClient` surfaces a `NaiveBuildTagWarning` per node when sing-box returns the upstream error string `naive outbound is not included in this build, rebuild with -tags with_naive_outbound`.

## 5.6 AnyTLS

Anti-DPI protocol (sing-box `type: "anytls"`, core ≥ 1.12.0): native
multiplexing with flexible padding over a plain TLS connection. Structurally
close to Trojan — `password` + TLS over TCP, no separate transport wrapper
(multiplexing is internal). Added in §269.

### URI Format

```
anytls://<password>@<host>:<port>/?<params>#<label>
```

AnyTLS has **no standardized share-URI** (sing-box documents JSON only). L×Box
accepts the de-facto Trojan-style form used by Karing / v2rayN mods.

| Component | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| userinfo `password` | Auth credential | required (empty → parse fails) |
| `host` | Server address (FQDN or IP, IPv6 in brackets) | required |
| `port` | TCP port | `443` |
| Query: `sni` / `peer` / `host` | TLS server name. Since §463 a value that cannot be a host name — no `.` and no `:` in it, e.g. `🔒` — falls back to the server address: `sing-box check` passes such a node, but the handshake is dead because the server is sent an SNI it does not know (contract §24.2 item 7.5) | `host` |
| Query: `fp` | uTLS fingerprint | `random` |
| Query: `pbk` / `sid` | REALITY public key / short ID (valid X25519 → REALITY, else plain TLS, §169) | none |
| Query: `key_share` | REALITY key share `hybrid` \| `classical` (§457, core lx.4+); read only with a valid `pbk`, outside the enum dropped | none |
| Query: `alpn` | comma-separated ALPN list | none |
| Query: `allowInsecure` / `insecure` | Skip cert verify (warns) | `false` |
| Query: `idle_session_check_interval` | Go-duration (`"30s"`) | core default (30s) |
| Query: `idle_session_timeout` | Go-duration (`"30s"`) | core default (30s) |
| Query: `min_idle_session` | int | core default (0) |
| Fragment `#label` | Display name | derived from `host:port` |

### Examples

```
anytls://password@server.example.com:8443#AT-01
anytls://pw@server.example.com                                             # port 443
anytls://pw@h.example:8443?sni=cdn.example.com&alpn=h2,http/1.1#TLS-tuned
anytls://pw@h.example:8443?idle_session_timeout=30s&min_idle_session=2#Idle
```

### Generated sing-box Outbound

```json
{
  "type": "anytls",
  "tag": "<label or anytls-host-port>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "password": "<pass>",
  "tls": { "enabled": true, "server_name": "<host>" },
  "idle_session_timeout": "30s",
  "min_idle_session": 2
}
```

### Behaviour Notes

- TLS is **always** enabled — `security=none` in the URI is ignored, and a
  sing-box JSON entry without a `tls` block is coerced to `enabled: true`
  (`server_name = host`). AnyTLS without TLS is meaningless.
- idle fields (`idle_session_check_interval` / `idle_session_timeout` /
  `min_idle_session`) are optional; when absent they are omitted from the
  outbound so the core applies its own defaults. They round-trip through the
  URI as query params.
- No `transport` block — AnyTLS multiplexes internally, unlike Trojan/VLESS.

## 6. SSH

### URI Format

```
ssh://user:password@host:port?query_params#label
```

Default port: **22**.

### Parsed Parameters

| Parameter | Source | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| User | userinfo (before `:`) | SSH username (defaults to `root`) |
| Password | userinfo (after `:`) | SSH password |
| Private key | `private_key` | URL-encoded private key content |
| Key passphrase | `private_key_passphrase` | Passphrase for private key |
| Host keys | `host_key` | Comma-separated host key strings |
| Host key algorithms | `host_key_algorithms` | Comma-separated CSV → array of allowed host-key algorithms |

### sing-box Outbound Mapping

```json
{
  "type": "ssh",
  "tag": "<label>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "user": "<user>",
  "password": "<password>",
  "private_key": "<key_content>",
  "private_key_passphrase": "<passphrase>",
  "host_key": ["ssh-rsa AAAA..."],
  "host_key_algorithms": ["ssh-ed25519", "rsa-sha2-256"]
}
```

### Notes

- Only password or private key authentication. No agent forwarding.
- `host_key` and `host_key_algorithms` are each split by comma into an array.
- NB: `parseSingboxEntry` (section 10, raw sing-box JSON) currently drops `host_key_algorithms` on round-trip — only the URI parser reads it.

## 7. SOCKS

### URI Format

```
socks://user:password@host:port#label
socks5://user:password@host:port#label
socks4://userid@host:port#label
socks4a://userid@host:port#label
```

Default port: **1080**.

**The scheme carries the protocol version.** A SOCKS link has no query
parameter for the version in any dialect, so the scheme itself is the
discriminator — the way the `proxy-https://` suffix discriminates TLS for the
HTTP proxy. Both ends read the same registry entry (`socks.json`): the link
mapper's `scheme_sets` (scheme → `version`) and the emitter's `emit.form_from`
(`version` → scheme), so a node parsed from `socks4://` is emitted back as
`socks4://`. There is no copy of the table in Dart (§562).

| Scheme | `version` in the body |
|---|---|
| `socks://`, `socks5://` | `"5"` |
| `socks4://` | `"4"` |
| `socks4a://` | `"4a"` |

### Parsed Parameters

| Parameter | Source | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Version | the scheme | SOCKS protocol version |
| Username | userinfo (before `:`) | SOCKS username; with `socks4` this is the userid |
| Password | userinfo (after `:`) | SOCKS password |

### sing-box Outbound Mapping

```json
{
  "type": "socks",
  "tag": "<label>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "version": "5",
  "username": "<user>",
  "password": "<password>"
}
```

### Notes

- `version` is written into the body explicitly, including the `"5"` the core
  would assume anyway: the value already stands in every live SOCKS node on
  both sides of the contract, and dropping it would rewrite them all for no
  difference to the core.
- A sing-box body is read as written: an explicit `"5"` passes through, a body
  with no key gets none. A version outside the set is dropped by the registry
  enum (`type_invalid`) and the node runs as SOCKS5, the core's default.
- SOCKS4 has no password at all — the userinfo is a userid, which the core
  sends as `username`. A password written in the link is still carried over as
  is: the mapper does not judge values, the core does.
- Username and password are optional.

## 7.5. HTTP(S) proxy

### URI Format

```
proxy-http://user:password@host:port?path=...&headers=...#label
proxy-https://user:password@host:port?path=...&headers=...&sni=...&fp=...&alpn=...&allowInsecure=1#label
```

Custom schemes are used instead of bare `http://` / `https://` (§222): the bare
schemes are intercepted by `isSubscriptionUrl` **before** `isDirectLink` (a pasted
link would become a “subscription”), and promotional lines like `https://t.me/...`
inside subscription bodies would turn into junk nodes. The scheme is the TLS
discriminator: `proxy-https://` → `tls.enabled=true`. The default ports are **80**
and **443** respectively.

### Parsed Parameters

| Parameter | Source | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Username | userinfo (before `:`) | Basic-auth username (`user`, `user:pass`, `:pass`) |
| Password | userinfo (after `:`) | Basic-auth password |
| Path | `path` | The sing-box `path` (a query parameter rather than a URI path — it round-trips more easily) |
| Headers | `headers` | Serialized like naive `extra-headers`: `Header1: V1\r\nHeader2: V2`, URL-encoded |
| SNI | `sni` / `peer` / `host` | `proxy-https://` only; the default is the host (the trojan convention, `registry/tls.json` → `blocks.uri_with_host.sni`, included by `registry/protocols/http.json` → `mappers.uri`) |
| Fingerprint | `fp` | The uTLS fingerprint (`proxy-https://` only) |
| ALPN | `alpn` | Comma-separated (`proxy-https://` only) |
| Insecure | `allowInsecure` and its aliases | `tls.insecure` → warning code `tls_insecure` |

### sing-box Outbound Mapping

```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "tag": "<label>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "username": "<user>",
  "password": "<password>",
  "path": "<path>",
  "headers": { "<Header>": "<Value>" },
  "tls": { "enabled": true, "server_name": "<sni>" }
}
```

### Notes

- Every field except `server` / `server_port` is optional — empty ones are not emitted.
- The JSON path (`parseSingboxEntry`) accepts listable `headers` values
  (string | [string, ...]) — just like naive `extra_headers`.
- REALITY does not travel in the URI (as with trojan) — the JSON path preserves it.
- The wizard's `HTTP` tab (§222): Tag/Host/Port/Username/Password plus an
  “HTTPS (TLS)” switch; fine-grained TLS settings go through the node's JSON editor.

## 8. WireGuard

### URI Format

```
wireguard://PRIVATE_KEY@host:port?publickey=...&address=...&...#label
```

The private key is URL-encoded in the userinfo position. Default port: **51820**.

Scheme aliases: `wireguard://`, `wg://`, `awg://` and `amneziawg://` — all four are parsed by the same endpoint logic (§097; `amneziawg://` is the protocol's full name, added by contract 1.1.48 and picked up from the registry rather than from a literal, §512). Panels (rrtrg and neighbours) write the full name, and before 1.1.48 such a link was rejected as an unsupported scheme even though the section could already read every one of its fields. The presence of AWG fields in the query (under any of the schemes) makes the node an AmneziaWG one — see [section 8.5](#85-amneziawg-awg-awg2).

### Second form: a whole `.conf` in base64

Under any of the four schemes the authority may be, instead of `key@host:port`, a base64 blob holding an **entire wg-quick file**:

```
awg://<base64 of the whole .conf>#label
amneziawg://<base64 of the whole .conf>#label
```

AmneziaWG 3.x panels hand out links in this shape (contract 1.1.23, L×Box 2.24.1 §450; `amneziawg://` joined the alias list in 2.25.2 §512). The registry declares it as the form `conf_b64` of the `wireguard` section (`registry/protocols/wireguard.json`), beside the ordinary `url` form.

**What marks the form** (both conditions, judged on the authority):

1. there is **no `@`** — the `key@host` form always has one;
2. the whole authority is base64 (`^[A-Za-z0-9+/=_-]+$`) — `wireguard://host:port?privatekey=…`, which also has no `@`, carries `:` and `?`, bytes outside that alphabet.

Both must hold: an authority without `@` is legal for a link that keeps the key in the query, so `@` alone does not decide.

**How it is read.** The authority is base64-decoded (std and url-safe, padded and unpadded alike), and the result is parsed as **INI, by the same rules as section 9** — `[Interface]` / `[Peer]`, the same field spellings, the same AWG and AWG 3.x keys, the same MTU clamp. There is one set of value rules for the two inputs, not two. Every parameter of the section names its source per form, so `privatekey`, for one, comes from the userinfo in the `url` form and from `Interface.PrivateKey` in `conf_b64`.

**The fragment is a label and is optional.** With no fragment the name falls back, in order, to the first `=`-less comment under `[Peer]` (where Proton and friends write the server name), then an import hint, then the peer address. The hint link is optional and L×Box passes none, so here the chain ends at the peer address — `awg://<blob>` with no fragment is named after the `Endpoint` host, not the literal `WireGuard`. The node's `rawSource` stays the original `awg://` link, not a `wireguard://` URI synthesised while parsing: the identity hash and the exported source are built from it.

One link is one node. A blob holding several `[Interface]` blocks is not an error and is not split — the first block is taken.

### Parsed Parameters

| Parameter | Query key | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Private key | userinfo | WireGuard private key |
| Public key | `publickey` | Peer public key (required) |
| Address | `address` | Comma-separated local addresses (required) |
| MTU | `mtu` | The MTU value (default 1408; on every AmneziaWG node, 3.x included, the registry caps it at 1280 — replaced on link/INI inputs, kept with an info code on a sing-box body, see [8.5](#85-amneziawg-awg-awg2)) |
| Pre-shared key | `presharedkey` | Peer pre-shared key |
| Keepalive | `keepalive` | Persistent keepalive interval: `N` seconds, or an AWG 3.x range `N-M` (emitted as the string `"N-M"`; the core re-picks the interval on every timer, §421) |
| Allowed IPs | `allowedips` | Peer allowed IPs (default: `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`) |
| Reserved / client_id | `reserved` or `client_id` | Cloudflare WARP client_id — 3 bytes, decimal `b0,b1,b2` or base64 (§025/§126). Emitted **per-peer** as `reserved: [b0,b1,b2]`. Without it a WARP handshake may complete but no data passes. |

### sing-box Endpoint Mapping

**Important**: In sing-box 1.12+, WireGuard uses the **endpoint** type, not outbound.

```json
{
  "type": "wireguard",
  "tag": "<label>",
  "mtu": 1408,
  "address": ["10.0.0.2/32", "fd00::2/128"],
  "private_key": "<private_key>",
  "peers": [
    {
      "address": "<host>",
      "port": <port>,
      "public_key": "<publickey>",
      "pre_shared_key": "<presharedkey>",
      "allowed_ips": ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"],
      "persistent_keepalive_interval": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

### Notes

- WireGuard is placed in the `endpoints` array in the sing-box config, not `outbounds`.
- The `address` field is split by comma into an array of CIDR strings.
- `allowed_ips` defaults to `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0` (route all traffic).
- `persistent_keepalive_interval` is only set when `keepalive` is present.

## 8.5 AmneziaWG (AWG, AWG2)

Added in §097 (the [`097`](./spec/tasks/097F-awg2-amneziawg2/spec.md) spec) together with the switch of the bundled core to the [`sing-box-lx`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx) fork (the `with_awg` build tag, `option.AmneziaWGOptions`; the version pin is `app/android/libbox.version`). AmneziaWG is WireGuard plus obfuscation: the same keys, peers and handshake, plus a set of parameters that disguise WG traffic from DPI.

Every field is **config-only** — nothing is negotiated over the wire, and the values **must match on the client and the server**. A mismatch fails silently: the handshake may succeed while no data flows.

### URI Format

```
awg://PRIVATE_KEY@host:port?publickey=...&address=...&jc=4&jmin=40&jmax=70&s1=0&s2=0&h1=...&i1=...#label
```

`awg://` and its full-name form `amneziawg://` are scheme aliases for the same endpoint logic as `wireguard://` / `wg://` (section 8). AWG fields are recognised in the query of **any** of the four schemes: with at least one field present the node is AmneziaWG (`WireguardSpec.awg != null`), and with none it is ordinary WG (backward compatible, with unchanged behaviour).

AmneziaWG 3.x panels more often hand out the other form — `awg://<base64 of the whole .conf>#label`, with the AWG 3.x fields written as INI keys rather than query keys. The shape, how the form is told apart and where the label comes from are in [section 8](#8-wireguard) under “Second form”; the field spellings are the same as for a pasted `.conf` (section 9).

### Fields

| Key | Type | Purpose | Level |
|------|-----|-----------|--------|
| `jc`, `jmin`, `jmax` | int | Junk packets before the handshake: the count and the size bounds | AWG 1.0 |
| `s1`, `s2` | int | A junk prefix on the init and response handshake packets | AWG 1.0 |
| `s3`, `s4` | int | A junk prefix on the cookie reply (`s3`) and on transport/data packets (`s4`) | AWG 2.0 |
| `h1`–`h4` | int \| `"N-M"` | Magic headers — substituting the packet types. A single `N` is 1.0; a range `N-M` is ranged headers (§112) | AWG 1.0 / 2.0 |
| `i1`–`i5` | string | CPS decoy packets, in the tag format `<b 0xHEX><r N>…` | AWG 1.5 |
| `id`, `ip`, `ib` | string | Masquerade sugar (WireSock-style) over `i1` — the core expands it into an `i1` CPS packet itself. **Mutually exclusive with an explicit `i1`** (both at once is a core startup error). §143 | AWG 1.5 |
| `headerprotectionkey` | base64, 32 bytes | Header protection key (`HeaderProtectionKey`, `awg genkey` on the server) → `header_protection_key`. Copied verbatim (url-safe/unpadded forms are normalised to std base64). With it set, each of `s1`–`s4` must be ≥ 12: the padding carries the header-cipher nonce. §421 | AWG 3.0 |
| `contentpaddingaddition`, `rekeyaftertime`, `rekeytimeout`, `rejectaftertime`, `keepalivetimeout`, `maxhandshakeattempts` | int \| `"N-M"` | Content padding and client-side timings → `content_padding_addition`, `rekey_after_time`, `rekey_timeout`, `reject_after_time`, `keepalive_timeout`, `max_handshake_attempts`. A single `N` is a JSON number, a range `N-M` a JSON string. §421 | AWG 3.0 |
| `randomtrailers`, `disablecookies` | `on`/`off` | Random trailers on data packets and cookie suppression → `random_trailers`, `disable_cookies`. `on`/`true`/`1` emits `true`; `off`/empty emits **nothing** (never `false`). §421 | AWG 3.1 |

- The numeric fields are uint32 and are emitted as a JSON **number**.
- `h1`–`h4` (§112): a value of `N` becomes an `int` (the numeric string `"5"` is normalised to `int 5`), while a range `N-M` becomes a `String` and is emitted as a JSON **string** (the core contract from `lx.6` onwards). We do not validate further (start ≤ end, uint32, non-overlapping ranges) — the core does that with an explicit startup error, and dropping silently here would produce a quietly broken handshake.
- `i1`–`i5` are strings and **case is preserved** exactly (they are case-sensitive and must not be altered).
- A malformed number in the query means the field is skipped silently (forward compatibility, as with `mtu` and `keepalive`) and parsing the node does not fail. For `h*`, “malformed” means it fits neither `N` nor `N-M`.
- AWG 3.x error policy (§421, mirrors the launcher's SPEC 123): a timing/padding value that is not a uint32 nor an **ordered** `N-M` range (`120-100` is not swapped, unlike `h1`–`h4` — a reversed timing is a typo the user must see), or a boolean that is not on/off, **drops the field** with the `awg3_field_invalid` warning; the node lives on the core defaults. A header protection key that is not base64 / not 32 bytes / all zeros, or a key with any of `s1`–`s4` below 12, **drops the node** (`awg3_header_key_invalid`, `awg3_padding_too_short`): the handshake cannot work and the core would reject the whole config. `random_trailers` together with a ranged `h1`–`h4` at least 65536 wide only earns the info `awg3_random_trailers_wide_headers` (the server's reference receiver may mistake upload packets for handshakes).
- The URI/`.conf` name of an AWG 3.x key is its JSON key lower-cased without underscores (`ContentPaddingAddition` / `contentpaddingaddition` ↔ `content_padding_addition`), the same rule as `Jc` ↔ `jc`. The share-URI emitter writes the booleans back as `on`. `H1`–`H4` equal to `1..4` are normal in AWG 3.x exports (the message type is masked by the header protection) and are not “fixed”.

> **`reserved` ≠ `reserved_zero[3]` — different things sharing the same bytes.**
> In LxBox terminology `reserved` is the **Cloudflare WARP client_id**, 3 bytes, emitted **per peer** (section 8, `reserved: [b0,b1,b2]`).
> In the WireGuard spec `reserved_zero[3]` means bytes `[1..3]` of the packet header, right after the message type at `[0]`; the magic headers `h1`–`h4` write **all 4 bytes** `[0..3]` at once (as a uint32), which is to say they overwrite exactly that `reserved_zero`.
> The bytes are physically the same; the meaning is not. Conflating them has already caused a real bug: unconditionally clearing `b[1:4]` for the WARP client_id wiped out ranged magic (fixed in core `lx.9`). When working with either field, be explicit about which one you mean.

The model is the `Awg` class in [`node_spec.dart`](../app/lib/models/node_spec.dart) (`WireguardSpec.awg`, where `null` means ordinary WG). The round trip is complete: URI / INI / sing-box JSON → `Awg` → `emit()` / `toUri()` with no loss. The order of AWG keys in the body is the same on all three inputs — AWG 3.x first, then the numeric AWG2 fields and `i*` — because golden configs are compared byte for byte.

### MTU clamp

Since contract 1.1.5 (§473) the rule lives in the **registry**, not in Dart: the ceiling, the default and the set of marker fields that make a node AmneziaWG all come from `wireguard.body.fields.mtu` (`max_when`, `default_when`). Since §472 step 7 the registry also **executes** it, on every input, through `RegistrySanitizer`; the hand-written `awgClampMtu` / `awgMtuByRegistry` / `awgMtuWarnings` are gone. Two cases the sanitiser cannot reach stay with the pipeline, and both would otherwise fail silently: a node that **asked** for AmneziaWG but kept no valid AWG field (the condition judges keys in the body, and none are left — §463), and a registry that failed to load (`kAwgMtuFallback`). No second copy of the numbers exists in the code.

For AWG nodes the client MTU is **clamped to `min(mtu, 1280)`**, and with no explicit `mtu` the default is **1280**. Ordinary WG is left alone (the core's own default of 1408 applies, and the field is not emitted at all).

**What makes a node AmneziaWG** is the presence of any one of ~27 marker keys (`jc`, `jmin`, `jmax`, `s1`–`s4`, `h1`–`h4`, `i1`–`i5`, `id`, `ip`, `ib`, `header_protection_key`, `content_padding_addition`, the AWG 3.x timers, `random_trailers`, `disable_cookies`). The condition judges the **presence of the key**, not whether the value is non-empty: `jc: 0` means “junk packets off” on a genuine AmneziaWG node, and reading it as “no field” would lift the ceiling off a node that needs it. This is the opposite of how `conflicts`/`requires` are judged (§467, by value) — the two predicates are deliberately separate.

**The input decides whether the value is replaced** (owner's decision of 2026-09-18 — the only place in the contract where the input affects the result):

| Input | `mtu > 1280` on an AWG node | Code |
|---|---|---|
| sing-box body (`origin.kind: json`, subscription bodies, a pasted object) | **kept as written** | `awg_mtu_high`, info |
| link (`wireguard://`, `awg://`), `.conf`, Amnezia export, editor form | replaced with 1280 | `awg_mtu_clamped`, warning |
| any input, `mtu` not set | 1280 substituted | none — a default is not a replacement |

The grounds are about ownership, not technology: a sing-box body was written in the core's own form by the user or the subscription, and rewriting that silently is not the app's to do; a value in a link or a `.conf` was made up by the provider's generator. The exception survives a restart by construction — the input is derived from `rawSource`, the very text kept in storage, and parsing runs afresh on every load. It is honoured by the build gate too, so §455 (a `json` node reaches the core verbatim) still holds.

Why 1280:
- it is both AmneziaWG's own recommended client MTU and the minimum IPv6 MTU, so it is safe on any path (PPPoE 1492, mobile, nested tunnels);
- the “exact” ceiling of `1500 − 60 − max(s3, s4)` is fragile — it assumes a path MTU of exactly 1500, which AWG users usually do not have;
- the risks are asymmetric: setting it too low only makes packets slightly smaller, while setting it too high fails silently (the handshake works, no data flows).

An explicitly lower MTU (≤ 1280) is respected as given.

**AWG 3.x is treated the same way** (§421, decision of 2026-09-05 after the device acceptance: with the 1376 an Amnezia export carries, no data flowed through the owner's server; with 1280 the tunnel worked). An AWG 3.x marker on its own — any AWG 3.x key, even a malformed one, or a ranged `keepalive` — makes the node AmneziaWG even without a single AWG 2.0 field, so it gets the 1280 default and the ceiling like any other AWG node. An explicitly lower value (1200) is respected.

### INI

AWG fields are read from the `[Interface]` section of a standard WireGuard INI (see section 9):

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <base64_key>
Address = 10.8.1.2/32
Jc = 4
Jmin = 40
Jmax = 70
S1 = 0
S2 = 0
H1 = 1234567890
I1 = <b 0xffffffff><r 16>

[Peer]
...
```

Keys are case-insensitive (`Jc` ≙ `jc`), while the case of the **value** is preserved. Converting INI → URI passes the fields through into the query (`i*` are URL-escaped).

### sing-box-lx Endpoint Mapping

The fields go into the **root of the endpoint** (next to `mtu` / `address` / `private_key`, **not** per peer):

```jsonc
{
  "type": "wireguard",
  "tag": "<label>",
  "mtu": 1280,
  "address": ["10.8.1.2/32"],
  "private_key": "<private_key>",
  "peers": [ /* as in section 8 */ ],
  "jc": 4, "jmin": 40, "jmax": 70,
  "s1": 0, "s2": 0,
  "h1": 1234567890, "h2": 1234567891, "h3": 1234567892, "h4": 1234567893,
  "i1": "<b 0xffffffff><r 16>"
}
```

Ranged headers (§112) — ranges as strings, single values as numbers, and the two can be mixed:

```jsonc
  "h1": "43613244-384550127", "h2": "826869626-2105069164",
  "h3": "2124774725-2141151992", "h4": "2144594503-2146278491",
```

Parsing back (the JSON editor, Smart-Paste) collects the same fields from the root of the entry (`Awg.fromJson` inside `parseSingboxEntry`).

### AmneziaWG versions: awg / awg1.5 / awg2 / awg3 / awg3.1 (§148, §421)

A node's subtitle and the variant filter (§102/§103) tell the **AmneziaWG version** apart structurally, by which fields are present in the config ([`config_node.dart`](../app/lib/models/config_node.dart)). This matches Amnezia's own versioning (they publish explicit config-format versions, with migration instructions for 1.0→1.5). The verdict comes from the highest marker present (priority top to bottom):

| Label | Version | What the version added | The marker in the config |
|-------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| `awg3.1` | 3.1 | Random trailers on data packets, cookie suppression | `random_trailers` **or** `disable_cookies` |
| `awg3` | 3.0 | Header protection, content padding, ranged client timings and keepalive | any other AWG 3.x root key (`header_protection_key`, `content_padding_addition`, `rekey_*`, `reject_after_time`, `keepalive_timeout`, `max_handshake_attempts`) **or** a ranged `persistent_keepalive_interval` (`"N-M"`) on a peer |
| `awg2` | 2.0 | Dynamics instead of static values: header ranges and random padding on transport messages | a ranged `h1`–`h4` header (`"N-M"`, §112) **or** `s3`/`s4` |
| `awg1.5` | 1.5 | Signature packets (CPS) — mimicry of a real protocol (a hex snapshot, e.g. a QUIC Initial), sent before the junk chain | any of `i1`–`i5` |
| `awg` | 1.0 | Basic obfuscation on top of WireGuard | `jc`/`jmin`/`jmax` (junk), `s1`/`s2` (init padding), single-valued `h1`–`h4` (magic headers) |
| — | — | ordinary WG | no AWG field at all → the security slot is empty |

**The 1.0→1.5 watershed** is the appearance of `I1` (Amnezia's official instruction: “add `I1` after the `H4` line”). `I2`–`I5` are additional signature packets of that same 1.5. **The 1.5→2.0 watershed** is the move from static `H1`–`H4` to dynamic ranges (plus `s3`/`s4` padding); a real 2.0 export can carry ranged H, `s3`/`s4` and `i*` all at once — the highest marker (2.0) wins.

The `+` suffix is added when the masquerade sugar `ip`/`id`/`ib` is present (§143). Core 009 expands those into an `i1` CPS packet itself, which means masquerade **on its own equals version 1.5**. That is why `awg+` cannot exist:

| Base (before the suffix) | + masquerade |
|--------------------|--------------|
| `awg3.1` / `awg3` / `awg2` | `awg3.1+` / `awg3+` / `awg2+` |
| `awg1.5` / `awg` / no AWG fields | `awg1.5+` |

The masquerade fields are mutually exclusive with an explicit `i1` at the core level (both at once is a startup error), but the label is derived from the raw JSON before validation — which is why the suffix is checked independently.

### The core requirement

This only works on the bundled `sing-box-lx` fork core (the `with_awg` build tag). Stock upstream sing-box does not know these fields and **rejects the config at load time**. Ranged headers (`"h1": "N-M"` as a string) require a core of at least `v1.13.13-lx.6` — an older core dies unmarshalling such a config (which is why §112 re-pins [libbox.version](../app/android/libbox.version) in the same commit). The AWG 3.x keys (§421) require at least `v1.14.0-lx.32` (`lx.33` fixes receiving data packets under `random_trailers`); a core up to `lx.31` rejects a config with any AWG 3.x key as a whole. The core ships inside the APK, so LxBox has no runtime gate for it — the pin is bumped in the same commit.

## 9. WireGuard INI Config

### Format

Standard WireGuard configuration file format:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <base64_key>
Address = 10.0.0.2/32, fd00::2/128
DNS = 1.1.1.1
MTU = 1420

[Peer]
PublicKey = <base64_key>
Endpoint = server.com:51820
PresharedKey = <base64_key>
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### Detection

Auto-detected when input contains both `[Interface]` and `[Peer]` sections.

The same text also arrives base64-encoded inside a link — `awg://<base64 of the whole .conf>#label`, see [section 8](#8-wireguard) under “Second form”. Once decoded it is read by the rules of this section, so the two inputs share one set of field spellings and value rules.

### Conversion

The INI text **is** the node's source (§456): it is stored as is, byte for byte,
comments included (`origin.kind: wg_ini`), and the Source tab of the node editor
shows that same text. The tag is not part of the text — it is a field of the
storage record. The initial name comes, in this order, from the first comment
right under `[Peer]` that has no `=` (Proton writes the server name there:
`# CH-FREE#11`), else from the file name on import, else `WireGuard`. The
`wireguard://` URI below is an internal step of the parser and never leaves it.

The INI config is converted to a `wireguard://` URI internally using `wireGuardConfigToUri()`:

1. Parse `[Interface]`: `PrivateKey`, `Address`, `MTU` plus the AWG fields `Jc`/`Jmin`/`Jmax`/`S1`–`S4`/`H1`–`H4`/`I1`–`I5` (§097, see [8.5](#85-amneziawg-awg-awg2); keys are case-insensitive, the case of the value is preserved, and `i*` are URL-escaped in the query) and the AWG 3.x keys `HeaderProtectionKey`, `ContentPaddingAddition`, `RekeyAfterTime`, `RekeyTimeout`, `RejectAfterTime`, `KeepaliveTimeout`, `MaxHandshakeAttempts`, `RandomTrailers`, `DisableCookies` (§421; passed through under the same lower-cased names)
2. Parse `[Peer]`: `PublicKey`, `Endpoint` (host:port), `PresharedKey`, `PersistentKeepalive` (`N` or the AWG 3.x range `N-M`, passed through as text), `Reserved`/`ClientId` (WARP client_id, §126)
3. Construct: `wireguard://host:port?publickey=...&privatekey=...&address=...&...#WireGuard`
4. The resulting URI is then parsed by the standard WireGuard parser (see section 8).

### Required Fields

- `PrivateKey` (in `[Interface]`)
- `PublicKey` (in `[Peer]`)
- `Endpoint` (in `[Peer]`)

Missing any of these throws a `FormatException`.

## 9.2 Amnezia vpn:// Link

Added in §110 (the task spec [`110`](./spec/tasks/110-amnezia-vpn-link-import.md)). This is Amnezia's container share format for awg2; a `.vpn` file holds the same string.

### Format

```
vpn://<base64url( qCompress(JSON, 8) )>   # a profile bundle
vpn://<base64url( bare wg-quick / AWG .conf )>   # a bare .conf (contract 1.1.48)
```

- base64url **without padding** (the `-_` alphabet, `Base64UrlEncoding | OmitTrailingEquals`); the padded and standard variants are accepted too (`decodeBase64Safe`).
- `qCompress` is 4 big-endian bytes (the uncompressed length) followed by a standard zlib stream. An uncompressed payload (bare base64 JSON) is the fallback, matching Amnezia's `importController`.
- **A bare `.conf` under `vpn://`** (the `bare_conf` payload form, contract 1.1.48 / §506): panels put the config itself under the wrapper, with no profile bundle around it. The form is judged by the same predicate as a `.conf` file — the first non-comment section is `[Interface]` — and the body then travels the ordinary wg-quick/AWG path, so the node is identical to the one the same `.conf` produces when pasted directly. Previously such a payload went to the qCompress branch, where the first four bytes of the INI were read as a declared length, and the user got zero nodes with a diagnosis about zlib that pointed at the wrong thing.
- Inside the JSON: `containers[]` → the `awg` / `wireguard` sub-objects → `last_config` (a JSON string; we defensively accept an object too) → `config`, a ready-made WG/AWG INI (section 9). The `$PRIMARY_DNS` / `$SECONDARY_DNS` placeholders are filled in from the root-level `dns1` / `dns2`.
- AWG 3.x exports (§421: the `amnezia-awg2` container with `protocol_version: "3.1"`) keep the MTU **outside** the INI — in `last_config.mtu` (the string `"1376"`) next to `config`. When `[Interface]` has no `MTU`, an `MTU = N` line is appended to the INI before the INI → URI conversion (one conversion point; an explicit `MTU` in `[Interface]` wins). The AWG 3.x keys themselves travel inside the INI (section 9).
- **One node in two forms inside one subscription** (§538): panels such as rrtrg send each AWG node twice — as an `amneziawg://` line and as a `vpn://` container. `parseAll` keeps the first record and moves every later record with the same `nodeDedupSignature` (the §480 identity: canonical emit without `tag`/`detour`, plus the dial path) to `dropped[]` with the app-only code `duplicate` ("Duplicate of <name>" when the names differ). Only within one body — never across subscriptions or against manual nodes.

### Detection / Flow

Step 0 in `decode()` ([body_decoder.dart](../app/lib/services/parser/body_decoder.dart)): `startsWith('vpn://')` → [`amnezia_link.dart`](../app/lib/services/parser/amnezia_link.dart) → `AmneziaConfig(iniTexts)` → `parseAll` → each INI through `parseWireguardIni`. Every WG/AWG container in the link becomes a node of **one** `UserServer` (`rawBody` is the original link, and persistence re-parses through the same path); Amnezia's other protocols (openvpn/xray/cloak/…) are skipped; if there is no WG/AWG at all the result is a `DecodeFailure` with an explicit reason.

### Limits

- The link must be ≤ 64 KiB (`maxURILength`) and the claimed uncompressed size ≤ 4 MiB — protection against zlib bombs.
- Reference: [config-decoder](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/config-decoder) (the reference implementation of the format), plus `exportController.cpp` / `importController.cpp` in [amnezia-client](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amnezia-client).

## 9.5 TUIC v5

Added in Parser v2 (the [`026`](./spec/tasks/026F-parser-v2/spec.md) spec). v1 had no TUIC parsing at all.

### URI format

```
tuic://<UUID>:<PASSWORD>@<host>:<port>?<params>#<label>
```

### Parameters

| Key | Value |
|------|---------|
| `congestion_control` | `bbr` \| `cubic` \| `new_reno` (the core's default is `cubic`; a value outside the set is dropped with `tuic_congestion_invalid` rather than coerced) |
| `udp_relay_mode` | `native` \| `quic` (the core's default is `native`). Since §463 a value outside the set is **dropped** with `tuic_udp_relay_mode_invalid` — it used to be coerced to `native`, which hid the loss of the subscription's intent, and core `lx.6` refuses to load such a config anyway |
| `alpn` | A CSV list (`h3`, `h3-29`) |
| `sni` | The SNI for TLS |
| `allow_insecure` / `insecure` | `1` \| `true` — skip certificate verification |
| `disable_sni` | `1` — do not send an SNI |
| `reduce_rtt` | `1` — enable 0-RTT / early data |
| `fp` / `fingerprint` | Read since §469 — **but only to report the loss**. TUIC runs over QUIC, where a uTLS fingerprint does not apply (see "TLS over QUIC" under Hysteria2); the value goes nowhere and the node gets `tls_not_applicable_quic` (`info`). Before 1.1.4 the parameter was not read at all and vanished without a word |

### sing-box outbound (emit)

```json
{
  "type": "tuic",
  "tag": "<tag>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": <port>,
  "uuid": "<UUID>",
  "password": "<PASSWORD>",
  "congestion_control": "bbr",
  "udp_relay_mode": "native",
  "zero_rtt_handshake": true,
  "tls": {
    "enabled": true,
    "server_name": "<sni>",
    "alpn": ["h3"],
    "insecure": false
  }
}
```

`tls.utls` and `tls.reality` never appear here: see "TLS over QUIC" under
Hysteria2 — the same rule covers hysteria, hysteria2, tuic and masque.

## 9.6 MASQUE (Cloudflare WARP)

A WARP transport following **RFC 9484 (CONNECT-IP over MASQUE)** — an IP tunnel
over QUIC/HTTP-3 with a fallback to HTTP/2. Added in **v2.9.0** (§130; sing-box-lx
core SPEC 021, `type: masque` through `outbound.Register`). It gives access to a
different pool of Cloudflare exit nodes (often foreign IPs) and looks to DPI like
ordinary HTTPS/QUIC to Cloudflare on 443.

MASQUE nodes are created through the **Get WARP** wizard (an ECDSA P-256 key is
registered on the device, `_addMasqueNode` → `account.toMasqueUri()` →
`parseMasqueUri`), but they round-trip fully through a `masque://` URI — they are
parsed from a paste or a subscription just like every other protocol.

> **Importing third-party Clash YAML MASQUE configs is not supported** — L×Box
> does not parse Clash YAML at all (for any protocol). MASQUE comes up only
> through our own registration or from a `masque://` URI.

### URI Format

```
masque://<privKeyDer>@<host>:<port>?publickey=<serverPubDer>&address=<v4,v6>&profile=cloudflare&vhttp=h3[&sni=...][&disable_sni=1][&mtu=1280][&idle_timeout=5m][&keep_alive=30s]#<label>
```

The keys are base64(DER) ECDSA P-256: `userInfo` (before the `@`) is our private
key (SEC1) and `publickey` is the server's public key (PKIX, used for pinning). A
raw `/` inside the base64 is escaped (§106). The default port is `443`.

### Parsed Parameters

| Key | Value |
|------|----------|
| userInfo / `privatekey` / `private_key` | base64(SEC1 DER) of the private key (**a secret**), required |
| `publickey` / `public_key` | base64(PKIX DER) of the server's public key, required |
| `address` | A CSV of the tunnel's local addresses (`v4,v6`), required; the CIDR is added automatically (`/32` / `/128`) |
| `profile` | `cloudflare` (default) \| `standard` |
| `vhttp` | The HTTP version: `h3` for QUIC (the default) \| `h2`. §393; the legacy name `network` is still accepted on input |
| `sni` | The TLS SNI; empty means the core's default (`www.cloudflare.com` since lx.25-rc.4) |
| `disable_sni` | `1`/`true` produces a ClientHello with no SNI. NOT a synonym for an empty `sni` (which is replaced by the profile's default). §393 |
| `mtu` | int, default `1280` |
| `idle_timeout` | A Go duration for the tunnel's idle-suspend. Empty = the key is not written and the tunnel is never suspended: the core's default is off, and the global `lx.masque.idle_timeout` (fork SPEC 098) is not written by LxBox; an explicit `0` or a negative value keeps the tunnel up whatever the global default (§128) |
| `keep_alive` | A Go duration for the QUIC keepalive (empty means `30s`; `vhttp=h3` only) |

**§393 — two generations of names.** The emitter writes only the new ones
(`vhttp`, a nested `tls{}`); the input side also accepts the old ones (`network`,
a flat `sni`), because URIs issued before the migration and links from elsewhere
are written that way. When both names are present, the new one wins. The core dies
on such a pair when the values DIFFER, which is why we never write the old and the
new name at the same time.

The key is named `vhttp` and NOT `transport`: in every other protocol
`transport` is an object `{type: ws|grpc|…}`, an entirely different thing. Here
the value is the HTTP version (`h3`/`h2`) as a flat string.

### sing-box Outbound Mapping

It is emitted as an **Outbound** (not an Endpoint, unlike WireGuard). `ip` and
`ipv6` are split out of `address` by looking for a `:` (v6). `mtu`,
`idle_timeout` and `keep_alive_period` are written only when non-empty; the
`tls{}` block appears only when an SNI or `disable_sni` is set.

The core's schema (§393, kernel SPEC 062): the HTTP version under the `vhttp`
key, and the TLS options in a nested `tls{}`.

MASQUE is a QUIC protocol, so `tls.utls` and `tls.reality` do not apply to it
either — see "TLS over QUIC" under Hysteria2. The MASQUE link format carries no
`fp`/`pbk`, so the rule shows up only on a hand-written body: it gets
`tls_not_applicable_quic` from the registry guard, and the block is stripped.

```json
{
  "type": "masque",
  "tag": "<tag>",
  "server": "<host>",
  "server_port": 443,
  "profile": "cloudflare",
  "vhttp": "h3",
  "private_key": "<privKeyDer>",
  "public_key": "<serverPubDer>",
  "ip": "172.16.0.2/32",
  "ipv6": "2606:4700:110:...::/128",
  "tls": { "server_name": "www.cloudflare.com" },
  "mtu": 1280,
  "idle_timeout": "5m",
  "keep_alive_period": "30s"
}
```

| deprecated | current |
|---|---|
| `network` | `vhttp` |
| `sni` | `tls.server_name` |
| `skip_cert_verify` | `tls.insecure` |
| `fragment` / `record_fragment` | `tls.fragment` / `tls.record_fragment` |
| `fragment_fallback_delay` | `tls.fragment_fallback_delay` |

The core accepts the old names until `v1.14.0-lx.30`, printing one warning per
outbound. The interim name `transport` (which lived for a single core rc) is not
supported in the client: it never went out.

**Fragmentation.** The global `tls_fragment` (§270) is applied to masque only
when `vhttp: h2`: with h3 there is nothing to fragment (QUIC does not carry TLS
over TCP), the core ignores such fields with a warning, and the builder skips h3
nodes silently.

**Fragmentation yields** (§574, contract 1.1.84). A node flag `tls.fragment`
is removed when the build gives the node a `detour` (code
`detour_with_tls_fragment`, info); `record_fragment` stays, it is the core's
own default under `detour`. With `tls.engine` `apple`/`windows` both flags go
(`tls_fragment_system_engine`): the system engine cannot fragment, and the core
would not start.

## 9.7 Tailscale (endpoint)

§435 (historical, node sections removed by §575) / §578 (registry `protocols/tailscale.json`).
A sing-box ≥ 1.12 **endpoint** (`type: tailscale`): tsnet runs in user space and joins the
tailnet by `auth_key`; the node has **no address** (`server`/`server_port` are empty) and
**no URI form** — it arrives only from sing-box JSON (`outbounds[]` or `endpoints[]`) or from
the Add Server Wizard's Tailscale mode.

- **Model:** `TailscaleSpec` keeps the body **as is** (`auth_key`, `control_url`, `hostname`,
  `ephemeral`, `accept_routes`, `exit_node`, `exit_node_allow_lan_access`, `advertise_routes`,
  `state_directory`, dial fields …) minus `type`/`tag`/`detour`; `toUri()` is the compact JSON
  text with `tag`, which `decode()` reads back as a single outbound.
- **Emission:** always into `endpoints[]`. If the body has no `state_directory`, the builder
  writes `<filesDir>/tailscale/<final tag>` (tag sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, the rest → `_`)
  at emission only — the stored body never gets a path (it is machine-specific).
- **Core gate:** the AAR must carry `with_tailscale` (fork `v1.14.0-lx.38` or newer; the
  gate is the registry node gate (contract §56): `build_tag` against the tag mirror `kCoreBuildTags` — there is
  no version constant). On an older core the node is **skipped at build** with the
  `tailscale_core_unsupported` warning line; the rest of the config builds. The node stays in
  storage — it survives a core update and a backup from a desktop.
- **Directions:** a node without a non-empty `exit_node` is **not** a Direction candidate (it
  does not reach the internet), so no selector lists it; it lives in Servers, the detour picker
  and chain positions. With `exit_node` it is a candidate like any other node.
- **Home, NETWORKS (task 579):** a node in `endpoints[]` of the built config, type `tailscale`,
  that the registry does not count as an exit (`exit_capable_when` false) is listed on Home
  under the pseudo-direction `NETWORKS`, the last entry of the Direction list, while the
  VPN is on. NETWORKS is not in the config or in storage. Its rows have no delay test and no
  node selection: a tap opens the node screen (View details), and the delay slot shows the
  node state from the core stream `SubscribeTailscaleStatus` (`BackendState`: `Running` →
  `running`, `NeedsLogin` → `sign-in needed`, `Stopped` → `stopped`, no record yet →
  `starting`, anything else → the core's `StateText`).
- **Network tab (task 581):** the node screens `node_settings_screen` and
  `node_inspect_screen` of a `tailscale` node have a Network tab before Diagnostics. It
  shows the node state, the network name, Sign in (`AuthURL`) and Log out
  (`TailscaleLogout`), this device (name, MagicDNS name, addresses, key expiry), the exit
  node list and the network's devices (online first, then by name; grouped by owner when
  there are several owners; tap → Copy name, Copy address, Ping via `StartTailscalePing`).
  VPN off → a hint; no record for the tag → “not in the running config”.
- **Exit node (task 581):** picking a list entry calls `SetTailscaleExitNode(tag, StableID)`
  and switches the exit on the fly; the node body does not change. When the saved
  `exit_node` and the active exit differ, the block shows a warning sign and Save choice
  (hidden on a subscription node). Save choice writes the active exit's Tailscale address
  (IPv4 first) into `exit_node` of the node source (None removes the field) and saves the
  node the way Save on the Source tab does. The core accepts in `exit_node` an address or
  a device name (base name or MagicDNS name), not a `StableID`; an address also resolves at
  start, before the peer list arrives. A choice made on the fly lives in the node's state
  directory (`ExitNodeID` in the tailscaled prefs) and survives a restart while the config
  has no `exit_node`; with `exit_node` in the config the config value wins at start.
- **Diagnostics (task 581):** a Tailscale node with no active exit hides the external-URL
  check and says so; with an active exit the check is as for any node (VPN off: the saved
  `exit_node` decides).
- **Privacy (task 581):** device names, addresses, the network name, owner names and the
  sign-in link are not written to the app log, the support dump or the Debug API; `GET
  /state` carries only `tailscale: {tag: {backend_state, devices}}`.
- **Probe:** not tested (no address; a probe config would have to join the tailnet) — “—” instead
  of a delay.
- **Companion records (preset, §578):** the template preset `tailscale` (on by default,
  `ui.num` 945) serves every Tailscale node in the config through `for_each` (see
  TEMPLATE.md): for each node a route rule `preferred_by: [<node>] → <node>`, a DNS server
  `{type: tailscale, tag: <node>-dns, endpoint: <node>}`, a DNS rule
  `preferred_by: [<node>-dns] → <node>-dns` (in a DNS rule the core looks `preferred_by` up
  among DNS servers, so it names the server, not the node) and a non-terminal `resolve` through that server
  right before the route rule. The DNS part follows the preset's `dns_enable` switch. The
  condition `preferred_by` asks the endpoint whether an address or a name is its own, and
  Tailscale answers from the live tailnet state (machine names, machine addresses, accepted
  subnets with `accept_routes`), so the preset carries no fixed subnets and no `.ts.net`
  suffix (launcher decision D-120). It matches only once the tailnet is up; until then the
  traffic follows the other rules. Two nodes in one tailnet claim the same machines, and the
  first by config order wins. A subscription node is served too. A server or a folder
  member opts out with the record field `skip_presets` (the **Skip presets** switch on the
  node screen, STORAGE.md). The DNS server tag stays `<node>-dns`, so user references to it
  keep working. The preset replaces the node's own bundle, which §575 removed: a node no
  longer carries route rules or DNS records of its own (see STORAGE.md “Node sections —
  removed”), and import no longer extracts any such bundle from a config — a config with a
  `tailscale` endpoint imports the node only, whatever route/DNS blocks sit next to it in the
  file are dropped like any other config's `route`/`dns` (§10 below).
- **Inside a subscription:** a `tailscale` node from a URL subscription gets the same preset
  bundle as any other node — no per-node exception any more.

## 10. JSON Outbound

### Format

Raw sing-box JSON pasted directly, or served as a subscription body. Four shapes are accepted (§368):

| shape | example | detection |
|---|---|---|
| single outbound | `{"type":"vless",…}` | object with `type` |
| array of outbounds | `[{"type":"vless",…},…]` | array whose first element has `type` |
| whole config | `{"log":…,"outbounds":[…],"route":…}` | object with `outbounds` or `endpoints`, no `type` |
| array of configs | `[{"outbounds":[…]},…]` | array of elements with `outbounds` carrying `type` (vs `protocol` → Xray, section 11) |

```json
{
  "type": "vless",
  "tag": "my-server",
  "server": "example.com",
  "server_port": 443,
  "uuid": "...",
  "tls": { "enabled": true }
}
```

All four normalize to a single parser (`parseSingboxConfigs`); the single-outbound case is an array of one config, so the passes below degenerate but the code path is the same.

### What is imported from a whole config

| section | imported |
|---|---|
| `outbounds`, `endpoints` | yes — nodes and groups |
| `route`, `dns`, `inbounds`, `log`, `experimental` | **no** |

Routing and DNS are generated by the app from its own settings, so a foreign `route` block has nowhere to map. The confirmation dialog lists the sections actually present that were left behind — the drop is never silent.

`direct`, `block` and `dns` outbounds are service entries and do not become nodes. `urltest` and `selector` become auto-select groups (below).

### Parsing logic (parity with section 11)

The same six principles as the Xray branch, adapted to the flat sing-box schema:

- **N nodes per config.** Every payload outbound becomes a node; `endpoints` (WireGuard/MASQUE since sing-box 1.11) are read alongside `outbounds`.
- **Two passes.** Configs are sorted by payload count ascending for a draft pass (so a single-node "country card" gets to name a server before a pool does), then emitted in file order. Positions stay authorial.
- **Names.** Unlike Xray — where the name lives outside the outbound, in `remarks` — sing-box carries it in the outbound's own `tag`, so no `remarks`-style arbitration is needed. A tag repeated within one config gets an index suffix; an empty tag falls back to `<type>-<server>-<port>`.
- **Dedup** by identity `protocol|server|port|credential`, scoped to one parse (one subscription). The key is taken from the finished `NodeSpec`, so it matches `nodeIdentityKey` by construction.
- **Tag synonyms** map provider tags to identities; they resolve both group membership and `detour` references that point into a neighbouring config element.
- **Nothing vanishes silently.** An unsupported `type` (or a malformed outbound that throws during conversion) leaves an `UnsupportedProtocolWarning` on a neighbouring node — one per type, not per outbound. A config that yields no node at all has no warning carrier; the import dialog's counters cover that case.

### Chains (`detour`)

`detour: "<tag>"` becomes a nested `chained` node, and emit unfolds it back to a `detour` field — the round-trip is closed. Any of the 13 types can be a hop (the Xray branch only ever saw `socks` and `vless` via `dialerProxy`).

| case | behaviour |
|---|---|
| target referenced by anyone | arrives as a hop, not as a standalone node |
| target referenced by several nodes | copied into each owner (identical copies, tags separated at build) |
| chain longer than 8 hops | truncated + warning |
| loop (`A → B → A`) | closing edge dropped + warning; **both nodes survive** |
| dangling tag | node kept, no chain + warning |
| `detour` to a group | node kept, no chain + warning |
| `detour: "direct"` | no chain, no warning — a direct exit is not a node here |

Loops are broken rather than rejected. This deliberately differs from §254, which treats a loop in the *user's own* config as fatal so the culprit can be untangled: here the loop arrived in someone else's file, before any node exists.

### Groups (`urltest` / `selector`)

Both become an `AutoSelectSpec`. `url`, `interval`, `tolerance`, `idle_timeout` and `interrupt_exist_connections` map one-to-one; absent fields take the app's own defaults. `mode`/`balancer` are a local extension (§208) with no upstream counterpart and are not read.

Membership uses **explicit identity keys**, not a tag regex as in §322 — inside a config a tag resolves to exactly one outbound, which has already been parsed, so there is nothing to guess. A member tag that yields no node (a service entry, a nested group — a group cannot be a pool member) drops out with a warning; if the whole membership empties, the group is not imported at all, since an empty `urltest` fails core startup.

`selector` is imported as auto-select with a warning: there is no manual-choice node type in the model, and losing a hand-built membership is worse than changing how the winner is picked. Its `default` field is ignored.

### Notes

- Entries are **re-parsed** into typed `NodeSpec`s via `parseSingboxEntry` — nothing is passed through verbatim. Supported `type` values: `vless`, `vmess`, `trojan`, `anytls`, `shadowsocks`, `hysteria2`, `naive`, `tuic`, `ssh`, `socks`, `http`, `wireguard`, `masque`.
- Because of the typed round-trip, fields the model does not carry are **not preserved** (e.g. ssh `host_key_algorithms`). `packet_encoding` is normalized to the allow-list and REALITY `public_key` is validated as X25519 (§169) — an invalid key degrades to plain TLS rather than emitting a config the core rejects.
- **TLS block (§454, contract TASKS_LXBOX §22):** the model carries every key of the core's `OutboundTLSOptions` (`option/tls.go`). Typed and gated: `server_name`, `alpn`, `insecure`, `utls`, `reality`, `certificate_public_key_sha256`. Passed through in the form they arrived (a string stays a string, an array stays an array; booleans only when `true`): `disable_sni`, `min_version`, `max_version`, `cipher_suites`, `curve_preferences`, `certificate`, `certificate_path`, `client_certificate`, `client_certificate_path`, `client_key`, `client_key_path`, `fragment`, `fragment_fallback_delay`, `record_fragment`, `kernel_tx`, `kernel_rx`. `ech` is passed through as an **object**: the map is copied as it arrived and emitted as is, the app never looks inside (the core owns the field set — `enabled`, `config` (Listable), `config_path`, `query_server_name`); a non-object `ech` is dropped like any other bad shape. §454 had excluded `ech` on the premise that the core is built without `with_ech` — that premise was false (`common/tls/ech_tag_stub.go` declares the tag itself deprecated, ECH is always compiled in, and `tls.ech` passes `sing-box check` on the lx.4 pin); §459 revises it. The URI parameter `ech=` of the Xray form is still stripped with `ech_ignored` (§320): it carries the name of a public ECH probe, not this server's key. Not emitted: unknown keys (the core rejects them on the whole config). Emit order follows the core struct, except that `alpn` stays before `insecure` for byte-parity with earlier releases (the identity hash sorts keys, so it does not care). Naive keeps `certificate`/`certificate_path` and `ech` of the passthrough set (`protocol/naive/outbound.go:139-155` reads the ECH block whole); QUIC types (hysteria2/tuic) keep it whole and drop `utls`/`reality` as before.
- The `tag` field is used for display; an absent tag falls back to `<type>-<server>-<port>`.
- This is for advanced users who want to specify the exact sing-box configuration, and for migrating from sing-box itself.

## 10.5 TCP keep-alive (dial fields)

sing-box dial options (core ≥ 1.13.0) that tune the TCP keep-alive probes of an
outbound's socket. They are **not** protocol settings: in the core they live in
`DialerOptions`, shared by every outbound that dials over TCP. Added in §453.

Without them the core applies its own defaults — first probe after 5 minutes,
then one every 75 seconds (`constant/timeout.go`).

### Keys

| Key | Type | Meaning | Default |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `disable_tcp_keep_alive` | bool | Turn keep-alive off on the socket entirely | `false` |
| `tcp_keep_alive` | Go-duration (`"30s"`) | Idle time before the first probe | core default (5m) |
| `tcp_keep_alive_interval` | Go-duration (`"15s"`) | Interval between probes | core default (75s) |

### Carriers

`vless`, `vmess`, `trojan`, `anytls`, `shadowsocks`, `naive`, `ssh`, `socks`,
`http` — nine types that dial over TCP.

QUIC/UDP types (`hysteria2`, `tuic`, `wireguard`, `masque`), `tailscale` and
group nodes do **not** carry the fields: there is no TCP socket to apply them
to. The keys are ignored on input and never emitted.

### URI Names

The query parameter names are identical to the sing-box keys:

```
vless://uuid@h.example:443?tcp_keep_alive=30s&tcp_keep_alive_interval=15s#KA
socks5://user:pass@h.example:1080?disable_tcp_keep_alive=1#NoKA
```

`disable_tcp_keep_alive` accepts `1` or `true`.

There is no share-URI standard for these fields — this is an L×Box extension,
following the AnyTLS precedent (5.6, §269). Other clients ignore unknown query
parameters. The URI form is required, not cosmetic: a node is stored as text
(URI or JSON), so without it the fields would be dropped on every re-save that
goes through `toUri()`.

VMess carries them as keys of the base64-encoded v2rayN JSON object, under the
same sing-box names; the cleartext VMess form uses the query tail.

Shadowsocks and SOCKS URIs gain a query string **only** when a field is set —
a node without them serializes exactly as before.

### Xray Mapping

Xray stores keep-alive in `streamSettings.sockopt` as whole **seconds**, not
duration strings:

| Xray `sockopt` | Value | L×Box |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| `tcpKeepAliveIdle` | `> 0` | `tcp_keep_alive: "<n>s"` |
| `tcpKeepAliveInterval` | `> 0` | `tcp_keep_alive_interval: "<n>s"` |
| either | `< 0` | `disable_tcp_keep_alive: true` (Xray sets `SO_KEEPALIVE=0`, `sockopt_linux.go:143`) |
| either | `0` | not set |

### Generated sing-box Outbound

```json
{
  "type": "vless",
  "tag": "KA",
  "server": "h.example",
  "server_port": 443,
  "uuid": "…",
  "tcp_keep_alive": "30s",
  "tcp_keep_alive_interval": "15s"
}
```

The fields are appended after the protocol keys, next to `detour` — both are
dial fields written from the same place in the emitter.

### Behaviour Notes

- Only non-empty values are written. `disable_tcp_keep_alive: false` and empty
  durations produce no keys at all, so a node without keep-alive settings emits
  byte-for-byte what it did before §453.
- A duration that is not a valid Go-duration is **dropped silently**, and the
  other two fields survive. Bare integers are read as seconds first (`30` →
  `"30s"`, D-024); anything still unparseable would make the core's
  `badoption.Duration` reject the **whole** config, so it never reaches it.
  No warning is raised — this is a power-user path, same as hysteria2 obfs
  (§358).
- There is no UI form field: the fields are entered through the Outbound JSON
  tab or arrive from an import.

## 11. Xray JSON Array

### Format

A JSON array where each element is a full Xray/v2ray configuration with `outbounds` containing `protocol` fields (Xray-style, not sing-box `type`):

```json
[
  {
    "remarks": "Server Name",
    "outbounds": [
      {
        "tag": "proxy",
        "protocol": "vless",
        "settings": {
          "vnext": [
            {
              "address": "server.com",
              "port": 443,
              "users": [{ "id": "uuid", "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision" }]
            }
          ]
        },
        "streamSettings": {
          "network": "tcp",
          "security": "reality",
          "realitySettings": {
            "serverName": "example.com",
            "fingerprint": "chrome",
            "publicKey": "...",
            "shortId": "abcd1234"
          },
          "sockopt": {
            "dialerProxy": "jump-server"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "tag": "jump-server",
        "protocol": "socks",
        "settings": {
          "servers": [
            {
              "address": "jump.com",
              "port": 1080,
              "users": [{ "user": "admin", "pass": "secret" }]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Detection

Auto-detected when input is a JSON array where the first element has `outbounds` containing at least one object with a `protocol` field.

Since §368 an array of *sing-box* configs has the same outer shape, so the elements decide: `type` inside `outbounds` → sing-box (section 10), `protocol` → Xray. Neither present (or an empty `outbounds`) stays Xray — this branch predates the sing-box one, and an ambiguous input must not be reclassified.

### Parsing Logic

Since §310, one array element yields **N nodes** — one per VLESS outbound — instead of a single "main" node. Providers put several equivalent servers (primary + fallbacks) into one element; collapsing them to one dropped the fallbacks.

1. For each element in the array, find all VLESS outbounds (`protocol: "vless"` with `vnext`).
2. Exclude outbounds referenced by another outbound's `sockopt.dialerProxy` — they are imported as a **detour server** of their owner, not as standalone nodes.
3. Convert each remaining VLESS outbound to its own sing-box VLESS outbound.
4. Node order — the "main" outbound comes first, so the first node stays what it was before §310:
   - Prefer the one with a `dialerProxy` in `sockopt` (chained proxy).
   - Else the one tagged `"proxy"`, else the first one.
5. If an outbound has `sockopt.dialerProxy`, resolve the referenced outbound and build it as a **detour server** (jump proxy) of that node only.
6. Naming — the first node takes the element's `remarks` verbatim; the rest get `remarks` + the outbound tag (`Main Server proxy-2`), falling back to an index suffix when the outbound has no tag. A single-VLESS element is named exactly as before.

### Supported Outbound Protocols

| Xray protocol | Converted to |
|---------------|-------------|
| `vless` | sing-box `vless` outbound (main or detour) |
| `socks` | sing-box `socks` outbound (detour only) |

### Chained Proxy (Jump/Detour)

When `streamSettings.sockopt.dialerProxy` references another outbound tag:
- The referenced outbound becomes a **detour server** with a tag prefixed by `"⚙ "`.
- The main outbound gets a `detour` field pointing to the detour server's tag.
- Supported detour protocols: SOCKS and VLESS.

### Xray to sing-box Conversion Details

**VLESS outbound:**
- `settings.vnext[0].address` -> `server`
- `settings.vnext[0].port` -> `server_port`
- `settings.vnext[0].users[0].id` -> `uuid`
- `settings.vnext[0].users[0].flow` -> `flow`
- Special flow `xtls-rprx-vision-udp443` -> `flow: xtls-rprx-vision` + `packet_encoding: xudp`. The port stays as the source gave it (§459; before that this branch forced `server_port: 443`)

**TLS (from `streamSettings`):**
- `security: "reality"` -> `tls.reality.enabled: true` with `realitySettings` mapped to `public_key`, `short_id`. REALITY is only built when the public key is a valid X25519 key (base64/base64url → 32 bytes); an invalid key degrades to plain TLS with a warning (§169).
- `security: "tls"` -> standard TLS from `tlsSettings` (`serverName`, `fingerprint`, `allowInsecure`)
- `flow` is taken verbatim from `users[0].flow`; it is **not** auto-derived from REALITY (§115). As in the URI path, Vision with a transport is dropped with a warning.
- ClientHello fragmentation -> `tls.fragment: true` on a node with TLS, from either of two Xray forms: `sockopt.dialerProxy` pointing at a `freedom` with `settings.fragment` (§488), or an element with `type: fragment` in `streamSettings.finalmask.tcp[]` (§573, contract 1.1.83; the element is found by type, not position). Xray's `packets`/`length`/`delay`/`maxSplit` are dropped without a code — the core splits by SNI labels itself. No flag when the node dials through a proxy hop or runs over UDP (hysteria/hysteria2); a `dialerProxy` to any `freedom` is not a hop.

**Transport (from `streamSettings.network`):**
- `ws` -> `wsSettings` mapped to `{"type": "ws", "path": ..., "headers": {"Host": ...}}`
- `grpc` -> `grpcSettings` mapped to `{"type": "grpc", "service_name": ...}`
- `http`/`h2` -> `httpSettings` mapped to `{"type": "http", "path": ..., "host": [...]}`
- `xhttp` -> `xhttpSettings` mapped to `{"type": "xhttp", "path": ..., "host": ..., "mode": ...}` (native, §097 — see [XHTTP transport](#xhttp-transport))
- `tcp` or empty -> no transport block

**SOCKS detour:**
- `settings.servers[0].address` -> `server`
- `settings.servers[0].port` -> `server_port`
- `settings.servers[0].users[0].user` -> `username`
- `settings.servers[0].users[0].pass` -> `password`

### Tag Generation

- Tags are derived from `remarks` field (or Xray outbound `tag`, or `xray-<index>`).
- Non-alphanumeric characters (excluding Cyrillic, CJK, flag emoji) are replaced with `-`.
- Maximum 48 characters.
- Detour server tags are prefixed with `"⚙ "`.

## Common Behaviors

### Label and Tag Extraction

- The URI fragment (`#...`) is URL-decoded and used as the display label.
- The tag (used internally by sing-box) is derived from the label.
- If the label contains `|`, the part after `|` becomes the comment.
- Flag emoji `🇪🇳` is normalized to `🇬🇧`.
- If no label is provided, the tag defaults to `<scheme>-<host>-<port>`.

### Skip Filters

Nodes can be filtered out during parsing using skip filters. Filters support:
- Exact match: `value`
- Negation: `!value`
- Regex: `/pattern/i`
- Negation regex: `!/pattern/i`

Filterable fields: `tag`, `host`, `label`, `scheme`, `fragment`, `comment`, `flow`.

### Base64 Decoding

The parser tries multiple base64 variants in order:
1. URL-safe with padding
2. URL-safe without padding
3. Standard with padding
4. Standard without padding

### URI Length Limit

URIs exceeding the maximum length (defined by `maxURILength`) are rejected with a `FormatException`.

### TLS Insecure Flag

Multiple query keys are checked: `insecure`, `allowInsecure`, `allowinsecure`, `allow_insecure`, `skip-cert-verify`. Values `1`, `true`, `yes` all enable insecure mode.

### ECH from subscriptions is ignored (§320)

Xray links carry ECH as `ech=<query-name>+<resolver-URL>` (e.g. `ech=ip.gs+udp://8.8.8.8`), sometimes as a bare `ech=<query-name>`. **L×Box does not apply it** — the parameter is dropped with the code `ech_ignored` (info severity, text from the contract registry: the node stays usable, only SNI masking is lost).

The form carries no ECH key. It says "fetch the ECHConfigList from the DNS HTTPS record of `<query-name>`", and the key so obtained belongs to that name. Subscriptions put **public ECH probes** there. Device-verified: DNS returns the *same* config list for both `ip.gs` and `encryptedsni.com`, decoding to `public_name = cloudflare-ech.com`, while the node's SNI is `www.ignitelimit.com` / `space.byu.id.yxls.eu.cc`. The key does not belong to the node's server, so the encrypted ClientHello is undecryptable and the handshake fails.

Measured on device (node `172.67.149.60` `/in-pdr`, path `/in-pdr`): **dead with `ech`, 723 ms without it.** NekoBox drops the parameter too — its database holds all 103 nodes of the same subscription with zero occurrences of `ech` — and keeps that node alive at 23 ms.

Suitability cannot be checked before connecting: `public_name` is only visible after the DNS query, inside the core's runtime, and sing-box has no fallback to plain TLS (`common/tls/ech.go` returns an error rather than degrading). A stricter rule (`ech` must equal the SNI) would still not prove the key belongs to the server, so the parameter is not applied at all.

`echfq` is not read either: it is Xray's pq-signature-schemes flag, and the core's counterpart is marked legacy and rejects the whole config when set.

**ALPN is passed through verbatim.** An earlier revision of §320 stripped `h2`/`h3` for ws/httpupgrade on the theory that HTTP/2 negotiation breaks the WebSocket upgrade. That was never measured, and such links usually list `http/1.1` alongside — client and server negotiate it themselves. The filter was reverted: the config follows the link.

---

## XHTTP transport

**Context.** XHTTP is the evolution of Xray's HTTP transport (formerly `splithttp`, late 2024): HTTP streams over TLS/Reality/h2c with separate upload modes. In subscriptions it appears as `type=xhttp` (VLESS, Trojan) or `net=xhttp` (VMess).

**Status.** Upstream sing-box does **not** support XHTTP (PR [SagerNet/sing-box#3879](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/pull/3879) was closed unmerged on 2026-03-09). Since §097 L×Box bundles the [`sing-box-lx`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx) fork core (the `with_xhttp` build tag, `option.V2RayXHTTPOptions`) and emits a **native** `{"type": "xhttp", ...}`. The former fallback of `xhttp → httpupgrade` plus an `UnsupportedTransportWarning` and an orange banner in the UI (Parser v2, up to and including v1.8.2) has been **removed** — nodes now connect over the real wire protocol.

**Parsing.** The sealed `XhttpTransport` ([`models/transport_spec.dart`](../app/lib/models/transport_spec.dart)) is assembled from three sources:
- the URI query — `parseTransport` in [`lib/services/parser/transport.dart`](../app/lib/services/parser/transport.dart); keys are read in both forms, camelCase (the Xray URI style) and snake_case (sing-box);
- sing-box JSON (`transport.type = "xhttp"`) — `parseSingboxEntry`;
- Xray JSON (`streamSettings.network = "xhttp"` plus `xhttpSettings`) — see section 11.

Since §463 the older name **`splithttp`** is accepted as an alias of `xhttp` on
all three inputs (in Xray JSON its settings object `splithttpSettings` is read
alongside `xhttpSettings`). Before that the name was not recognised at all and
such a node reached the config with **no transport** — a plain TCP dial to a
port expecting HTTP, dead without a single message. Contract §24.2 item 7.13.

Where each input gets the alias from, and why it is not one place: the registry
expresses it **only for the Xray dialect** (`transports.json` →
`blocks.xray.$selector.network.value_map`). For a **link** the set of spellings
`blocks.uri.$selector.type` is closed by a `when.in` that does not list
`splithttp`, and a `when.in` suppresses the entry whole — so the selector never
fires and no transport is built at all. Moving the link input onto the engine
(§480) therefore brought the old silent breakage back, and the corpus could not
catch it: only the Xray input is normalised there (`body/xray/vless_splithttp`).
It is closed in **data** — the `$selector.type` entry of our overlay
`assets/contract_draft/uri/transports.json`, a verbatim copy of the registry
entry plus `splithttp` in both `when.in` and `value_map` (delta `delta480-8`).
Contract **1.1.37** then added the spelling to the registry set itself, so the
overlay is redundant and is removed with that sync — the behaviour and the
node bodies do not move, the registry entry says the same thing.

Since §127 the **full client-side set** of Xray splithttp is supported (SPEC 002 v2): beyond the six basic fields there are configurable session/seq/uplink placements, their keys, the upload method, the X-Padding obfuscation mode and packet-up tuning. In a URI these come from flat query parameters **and** from the `extra` parameter (URL-encoded JSON, see below).

| Field (snake_case JSON) | URI query (camelCase / snake) | Default |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `path` | `path` | `/` |
| `host` | `host` (falls back to `sni`) | empty |
| `mode` | `mode` | empty — the core decides (auto). Enum, case-sensitive: `auto`, `packet-up`, `stream-up`, `stream-one`; anything else is dropped with `xhttp_param_reset` (§459) |
| `x_padding_bytes` | `xPaddingBytes` | empty |
| `no_grpc_header` | `noGRPCHeader` | false |
| `headers` | — (JSON only) | empty |
| `session_placement` | `sessionPlacement` (Xray proto: `sessionIDPlacement`) | `path` |
| `session_key` | `sessionKey` (Xray proto: `sessionIDKey`) | placement-dependent |
| `seq_placement` | `seqPlacement` | `path` |
| `seq_key` | `seqKey` | placement-dependent |
| `uplink_data_placement` | `uplinkDataPlacement` | `auto` |
| `uplink_data_key` | `uplinkDataKey` | placement-dependent |
| `uplink_chunk_size` | `uplinkChunkSize` | placement-dependent |
| `uplink_http_method` | `uplinkHTTPMethod` | `POST` |
| `x_padding_obfs_mode` | `xPaddingObfsMode` | false |
| `x_padding_key` | `xPaddingKey` | `x_padding` |
| `x_padding_header` | `xPaddingHeader` | `X-Padding` |
| `x_padding_placement` | `xPaddingPlacement` | `queryInHeader`. Enum, case-sensitive: `cookie`, `header`, `query`, `queryInHeader` (camelCase only — `queryinheader` is dropped); anything else → `xhttp_param_reset` (§459) |
| `x_padding_method` | `xPaddingMethod` | `repeat-x`. Enum, case-sensitive: `repeat-x`, `tokenish`; anything else → `xhttp_param_reset` (§459) |
| `sc_max_each_post_bytes` | `scMaxEachPostBytes` | `1000000` |
| `sc_min_posts_interval_ms` | `scMinPostsIntervalMs` | `30` |

Every empty or default field is **not emitted** (omitempty) — the core has its own defaults. NB: VMess (base64 JSON) carries only `path` and `host`; the extended fields are available in the URI forms (VLESS/Trojan) and in JSON.

**The `extra` parameter (URL-encoded JSON).** Real subscriptions often pack some of the fields (especially the `scMaxEachPostBytes` / `scMinPostsIntervalMs` tuning) into a single query parameter, `extra=<urlencoded-json>`. The parser decodes it and merges its keys into the transport (`extra` wins for its own keys). **A malformed or truncated `extra` is ignored** — the link keeps working on the flat parameters. Numbers from `extra` are coerced to strings (`30.0` → `"30"`), and a `path` with a `?` tail is trimmed. Xray proto names `sessionIDPlacement` / `sessionIDKey` inside `extra` (and as flat query params) map to `session_placement` / `session_key` (§508; launcher [#131](https://github.com/Leadaxe/singbox-launcher/issues/131)). `sessionIDLength` / `sessionIDTable` are not mapped: `"0"` without a table means unset. The mapping reference is `SPECS/002-XHTTP_CLIENT_TRANSPORT/URL_PARSING.md` in the core's repository.

**The modes (`mode`).**

| mode | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| omitted / `auto` | the core decides; in the current sing-box-lx that means `packet-up` |
| `packet-up` | the uplink is cut into separate POST requests (with sequence numbers), the downlink is a single GET stream |
| `stream-up` | the uplink is one streaming POST, the downlink a GET stream |
| `stream-one` | a single bidirectional stream — everything in one request |

**Placement (§127).** Where the transport puts its bookkeeping data on each request, so that logical connections can be demultiplexed over a single HTTP origin:
- `session_placement` / `seq_placement` — the session id and the packet number: `path` | `query` | `header` | `cookie` (default `path`);
- `uplink_data_placement` — the payload upload in packet-up: `body` | `auto` | `header` | `cookie` (default `auto`, ≈ body);
- `*_key` — the key name for a non-path placement (the default depends on the placement: `X-Session` / `x_session` and so on).

**Obfuscation:**
- `x_padding_bytes` — the range of random padding, for example `"100-1000"`;
- `no_grpc_header` — do not send the gRPC wrapper in `stream-up`;
- `x_padding_obfs_mode` — the switch for configurable obfuscation (instead of the legacy padding in `Referer`); under it sit `x_padding_placement` (`cookie`|`header`|`query`|`queryInHeader`), `x_padding_method` (`repeat-x` | `tokenish` — HPACK-Huffman) and their own key/header.

**Normalization (§217).** `parseTransport` reads the fields verbatim; `toSingbox` does the checking. The core rejects values outside the enum sets **fatally** (one malformed node would take the whole config down at startup), so such fields are **not emitted** and the node gets an `XhttpParamResetWarning` (a ⚠️ in the subscription plus a line in the AppLog):

- the allow-lists: `session_placement`/`seq_placement` ∈ {`path`,`query`,`header`,`cookie`}; `uplink_data_placement` ∈ {`body`,`auto`,`header`,`cookie`}; `x_padding_placement` ∈ {`cookie`,`header`,`query`,`queryInHeader`}; `x_padding_method` ∈ {`repeat-x`,`tokenish`};
- the mode-dependent rules (valid only with `mode=packet-up`): `uplink_http_method=GET`, and `uplink_data_placement` = `header`/`cookie`. Outside packet-up those values are reset with a warning.

A malformed value never kills the config — the field is dropped and the node keeps working on the core's defaults.

**Generated transport block:**

```json
"transport": {
  "type": "xhttp",
  "path": "/path",
  "host": "cdn.example.com",
  "mode": "packet-up",
  "x_padding_bytes": "100-1000",
  "no_grpc_header": true,
  "session_placement": "header",
  "seq_placement": "query",
  "x_padding_obfs_mode": true,
  "x_padding_method": "tokenish",
  "sc_max_each_post_bytes": "1000000"
}
```

(The extended placement, obfuscation and tuning fields are optional; by default only the six basic ones are emitted.)

**Incompatible with Vision.** `flow=xtls-rprx-vision` only lives on “bare” TCP — combined with XHTTP (as with ws/grpc/h2) it is invalid by protocol. The parser does not auto-fill `flow` when a transport block is present (see TLS Behavior in section 1); a config with an explicit `flow` plus xhttp will not work against a server.

**Round trip.** `XhttpTransport.toSingbox` produces the transport map (empty fields are not emitted); the share URI is assembled by the **mapper section** that also parses it (§480 W7 — the handwritten `transportToQuery` is gone), in flat **camelCase** (the Xray form, for interop with v2rayN and Xray), carrying only **non-default** fields (`omit_default` on the entry) — so the URI does not bloat and the invariant `parseUri(toUri(spec)) ≈ spec` holds (on input, an empty field and a default one yield the same spec). No `extra` is generated on output — the fields are expanded flat. `httpupgrade` remains a **separate** transport and is no longer a “receiver” for xhttp.

**A note on the stock core.** On upstream sing-box (without `with_xhttp`) a config containing `"type": "xhttp"` is rejected at load time (`unknown transport type`). The feature works only on releases carrying the bundled fork core — just like AWG (section 8.5).
