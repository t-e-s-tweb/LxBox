# Final config editor — the core config as editable, highlighted JSON

The Config Editor screen shows the saved sing-box config with line numbers and
syntax highlighting and saves an edited, pasted or loaded config to the core.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Feature | [019-CONFIG_EDITOR](../FEATURE.md) |
| Promises | P1–P5, P8, P9 |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-28 |

## What it does

The "Config Editor" screen (side menu: "View, edit, import JSON") shows the
saved core config as formatted JSON with line numbers and syntax
highlighting, lets the user tweak it, substitute text from the clipboard or a
file, copy it, share it and save it to the core.

## Parameters

| Action | Where | Behavior |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Save | AppBar | JSON5 parse → canonical JSON → save; snackbar "Config saved" |
| Paste from clipboard | ⋮ menu | clipboard text, formatted, into the editor; empty clipboard — "Clipboard is empty" |
| Load from file | ⋮ menu | file text (UTF-8), formatted, into the editor |
| Copy to clipboard / Copy icon | ⋮ menu / editor corner | the whole editor text to the clipboard |
| Share | ⋮ menu | `lxbox_config.json` file with the editor text |
| Read-only threshold | — | above 1 048 576 characters |

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** the saved config at the moment of opening; the clipboard; the
chosen file; selection gestures.

**Outputs:** the config saved to the core; the clipboard; the file for Share;
snackbars and errors on screen.

## Rules and invariants

- **Formatting in the background.** Opening and text substitution format JSON5
  with a 2-space indent off the main thread; while it runs — a progress bar.
  Unparseable text — as is.
- **Saving is strict in meaning, lenient in syntax.** Comments and trailing
  commas are allowed; compact canonical JSON goes to the core. Empty — "Config
  is empty"; syntax — "Failed to parse config: …" with the position; the core
  config does not change.
- **Substitution ≠ saving.** Paste and Load from file change only the editor
  text.
- **Read-only** for a config that is too large: banner "File is too large to
  edit on device. Share it, edit externally, then load it back.", Save is
  disabled.
- **One-way.** A saved edit works until any UI action rebuilds the config from
  the settings; the menu screens do not see it. To keep the edit — pinning
  ([config-pin.md](config-pin.md)).
- **Tunnel up.** Saving does not restart the core; if the config differs from
  the running one — the "config changed" flag.
- **Selection menu** (shared by all JSON fields of the app): long tap — Cut /
  Copy / Paste / Select all over the live selection (a read-only field offers
  only Copy / Select all, §607); the action, then the menu is removed. There is one menu; it is removed by a tap on empty space
  (the selection collapses), a scroll, or leaving the screen; a screen redraw
  does not spawn copies.
- A file picking error or a missing file manager — a clear text, not a
  technical exception.

## Boundaries

- Shows the saved file, not a snapshot of the running core.
- Comparison with the running config and restart — [003-CONFIG_BUILD](../../003-CONFIG_BUILD/FEATURE.md),
  [010-VPN_SERVICE](../../010-VPN_SERVICE/FEATURE.md).
- There is no reverse parsing into settings (issue #3).
