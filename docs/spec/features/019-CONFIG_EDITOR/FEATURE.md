# Config editor — viewing, editing and pinning the final sing-box config

LxBox shows the final sing-box config that the core runs as formatted JSON and
lets advanced users edit, import, export or pin it. The Config Editor accepts
JSON5, checks the text before saving and keeps very large configs read-only. The
same JSON view appears on a node, with copying of its detour chain, and in a
routing rule preview; through the Debug API a hand-made config can be pinned so
that rebuilds do not overwrite it.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Feature | 019-CONFIG_EDITOR |
| Type | Product feature |
| Absorbed | `§007F` |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-28 |

## Purpose

An advanced user needs to see exactly what the core will get, and sometimes to
tweak it by hand or slip in a config of their own. The feature provides the
"Config Editor" screen (side menu) — the saved core config as formatted JSON
with highlighting, editing, import and export; viewing JSON fragments of the
config in other places (a node, a rule preview); and pinning the config for
experiments through the Debug API.

The feature protects three principles:

- **The source of truth is the settings, not the text.** The pipeline is
  one-way: settings → build → config. A manual edit lives until the next
  rebuild (issue #3, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Known limitations").
- **An edit does not break the core.** Only parsed and canonicalized JSON goes
  to the core; a syntax error is a message, not a write.
- **What you selected is what you copy.** The context menu acts on the real
  selection and does not multiply.

## Promises

- **P1. The config opens formatted.** 2-space indent; unparseable text is shown
  as is, without a crash. **Witness:** unit "background formatting matches
  synchronous formatting"; invalid — manual check (Paste from clipboard with
  garbage). **Mutation:** a crash on invalid text.
- **P2. JSON5 is accepted, canonical JSON goes to the core.** `//` `/* */`
  comments and trailing commas are allowed; compact JSON is saved. **Witness:**
  units "canonicalization accepts JSON5 comments", "background canonicalization
  matches synchronous canonicalization". **Mutation:** text with comments goes
  to the core.
- **P3. A syntax error is a message with a position; the config does not
  change.** Empty text — "Config is empty". **Witness:** units "a JSON5 syntax
  error becomes a format error", "background canonicalization returns an error
  with text"; empty — manual check. **Mutation:** an unhandled exception.
- **P4. A large config is read-only.** Above 1 048 576 characters the editor
  does not allow editing and suggests Share → external editor → Load from file.
  **Witness:** unit "read-only threshold boundary". **Mutation:** editing a
  multi-megabyte text on the device.
- **P5. A manual edit does not survive a rebuild.** **Witness:** manual check —
  edit in the editor, Save, toggle any routing setting, come back: the editor
  shows the built config (no autotest). **Mutation:** the edit "sticks"
  without pinning.
- **P6. A pinned config is not overwritten.** While pinned, rebuilds triggered
  by UI actions are silently skipped; an explicit rebuild through the Debug
  API answers 409. **Witness:** unit "locked=true → actionRebuildConfig
  бросает Conflict до requireSub/Home", "locked=false → gate пропускает,
  падает дальше на requireSub (не на lock)", "PUT /settings/config_locked
  {"locked":true} → GET /state/config_locked отдаёт true", "PUT
  /settings/config_locked {"locked":false} снимает лок" — **покрыто
  2026-09-30:** `test/services/debug/config_locked_rebuild_gate_test.dart`.
  UI side (rebuilds triggered by UI actions silently skipped) — manual check,
  no autotest. **Mutation:** remove the lock check from
  `automation.actionRebuildConfig` — a rebuild while pinned goes through.
- **P7. The pin is never orphaned.** The toggle is visible only when the Debug
  API is enabled; turning the Debug API off in settings removes the pin.
  **Witness:** manual check (no autotest) — `_toggleDebugApi` in
  `app_settings_screen.dart` is widget `State` logic with no pure-Dart seam.
  **Mutation:** the lock stays with the API turned off.
- **P8. The selection menu works with what is selected.** Long tap — Cut / Copy
  / Paste / Select all menu, the selection does not collapse. **Witness:** units
  "long tap: menu shown, selection not collapsed", "tap Copy puts the selected
  fragment on the clipboard", "tap Cut…", "tap Paste…", "tap Select all…".
  **Mutation:** the menu as a modal window (the selection is lost before the
  action).
- **P9. There is one menu, and it goes away.** A tap on empty space, a scroll or
  leaving the screen removes the menu; repeated long taps and redraws do not
  spawn copies. **Witness:** units "§521 …" (eight scenarios). **Mutation:** a new
  menu instance on every redraw.
- **P10. A node's JSON is copied in the right form.** Without a detour — "Copy
  JSON"; with a detour — "Copy server JSON" / "Copy detour" / "Copy server +
  detour(s)"; copies have no `detour` field, a chain is copied whole.
  **Witness:** manual check (no autotest). **Mutation:** a copy with a dangling
  `detour`.
- **P11. A rule preview does not depend on whether the rule is enabled.**
  **Witness:** manual check (disabled rule → the View tab is not empty); the
  build skips disabled rules — unit "a disabled json rule is skipped
  (skipDisabled)". **Mutation:** an empty preview for a disabled rule.

## Controlled parameters

| Knob | Where | Values | Default |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| Lock config (debug) | App Settings → Diagnostics, when the Debug API is enabled | on/off | off |
| Read-only threshold | — | 1 048 576 characters | fixed |

Debug API (contract — [027-DEBUG_API](../027-DEBUG_API/FEATURE.md)):
`GET /config` (`?pretty`), `PUT /config` (raw JSON object),
`GET /state/config_locked`, `PUT /settings/config_locked {"locked": bool}`,
`POST /action/rebuild-config` (409 while pinned). The feature produces no core
config keys — it shows and writes the config as a whole.

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** the saved config; text from the editor, the clipboard or a file;
Debug API requests; selection gestures.

**Outputs:** the config saved to the core (and the "config changed" flag with
the tunnel up); the clipboard; the `lxbox_config.json` file for Share;
snackbars "Config saved", "Pasted from clipboard", "Loaded from file", errors.

## Data flow

```
saved config → formatting (in the background) → editor
editor / clipboard / file → JSON5 parse → canonical JSON → save to the core
                                   └─ error → message, config unchanged
any UI action → [pinned?] ─ no  → rebuild from settings (edit erased)
                          └─ yes → skip, config unchanged
```

## Rules and guarantees

- The editor shows the saved file, not a snapshot of the running core; the
  node JSON view with the tunnel up is a snapshot of the core.
- "Paste from clipboard" and "Load from file" only put the text into the
  editor; it goes to the core on Save.
- Save is available while nothing is busy and the config is not read-only.
- The pin is stored in the settings; removing it does not trigger a rebuild by
  itself — the next action will do it.

## Boundaries

- There is no reverse parsing of the config into settings: an edit is
  invisible to the menu screens.
- The build, its gates and the "config changed" flag —
  [003-CONFIG_BUILD](../003-CONFIG_BUILD/FEATURE.md); settings storage and
  backup — [017-BACKUP_AND_STORAGE](../017-BACKUP_AND_STORAGE/FEATURE.md).
- Editing a single node and its form — [008-NODE_EDITOR](../008-NODE_EDITOR/FEATURE.md).
- File picking depends on OS capabilities (on a TV without a file manager — a
  hint about the clipboard).

## Functions

  build → config pipeline whose output the editor shows; the build's gates,
  comparison with the running config and the "config changed" flag.
- [027-DEBUG_API](../027-DEBUG_API/FEATURE.md) — transport, token and port
  of the Debug API through which the config is written and pinned
  ([access-and-security](../027-DEBUG_API/FUNCTIONS/access-and-security.md),
  [write-operations](../027-DEBUG_API/FUNCTIONS/write-operations.md)).

  backup of the settings the config is built from.
- [008-NODE_EDITOR](../008-NODE_EDITOR/FEATURE.md) — editing a single node; here
  the node's JSON is only viewed and copied.
- [004-ROUTING](../004-ROUTING/FEATURE.md) — rules are edited there; the View
  tab of a rule is the preview from this feature.
- [002-NODE_IMPORT](../002-NODE_IMPORT/FEATURE.md) — the node link (`Copy URI`)
  is not JSON and lives in the node menu.
- [010-VPN_SERVICE](../010-VPN_SERVICE/FEATURE.md) — restarting the running
  core; saving from the editor does not restart it.
- [018-WORKSPACES](../018-WORKSPACES/FEATURE.md) — the pin is stored among the
  app settings and belongs to the current set.

## Maintenance notes

- **Large text — only the line-by-line editor.** A single-paragraph field on a
  config of hundreds of KB gave 100 % CPU and process death (333).
- **The context menu is not a modal window.** A modal one takes the focus, and
  the selection collapses before the action (517); the menu instance must live
  exactly as long as the editor (521).
- **`PUT /config` is stricter than the editor:** it accepts only a plain JSON
  object.
