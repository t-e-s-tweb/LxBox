# Operating modes — system VPN, local proxy or both

The core receives traffic through a device-wide VPN tunnel, a local
HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy port, or both at once.

| Field | Value |
|------|----------|
| Feature | [010-VPN_SERVICE](../FEATURE.md) |
| Promises | P5, P6 |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-28 |

## What it does

Chooses how the core receives traffic: a system tunnel for the whole device, a
local proxy port that apps use by explicit configuration, or both at once. For
the port it sets the protocol, address, number and authentication. For the
tunnel — whether apps are allowed to bypass it.

## Parameters

| Setting | Values | Default |
|---------|--------|---------|
| VPN mode | `vpn` — system tunnel; `proxy` — port only; `vpn_proxy` — both | `vpn` |
| Local proxy protocol | `mixed` (HTTP+SOCKS5 on one port), `http`, `socks` | `mixed` |
| Listen address | any IPv4; in the list `127.0.0.1` (this device only), `0.0.0.0` (LAN) | `127.0.0.1` |
| Listen port | 1024..65535 | 2080 |
| Require authentication | on/off; outside `127.x` — forced on | on |
| Username / Password | string / password with the "Show", "Regenerate" buttons | `user` / generated 32 hex |
| Allow VPN bypass | on — apps may explicitly go around the tunnel | off |

Port settings are visible only in modes with a port; "Keep VPN on exit" and
"Allow VPN bypass" — only in modes with a tunnel.

## Inputs / Outputs

**Input:** the user's choice (mode screen, Debug API).
**Output to the core config:** `inbounds[]` —
`{type: tun, tag: tun-in, …}` in `vpn`/`vpn_proxy`;
`{type: mixed|http|socks, tag: mixed-in, listen, listen_port, users?}` in
`proxy`/`vpn_proxy`. The `mixed-in` tag does not depend on the protocol.
`users` is written only with effective authentication and a non-empty
password. `route.final` does not depend on the mode.

## Rules and invariants

- The `vpn` mode gives the same config as before modes existed; a missing
  setting = `vpn`.
- Traffic parsing rules (resolve, sniff) apply to the port input the same way
  as to the tunnel one: in `proxy` they move to the port, in `vpn_proxy` they
  apply to both; a disabled sniff appears on neither. DNS hijack applies to all
  inputs.
- An address outside `127.x` makes authentication mandatory, the toggle is
  locked; enabling authentication, choosing such an address or a mode with a
  port while the password is empty generates a password. The screen and the
  Debug API hold the same invariant; the build does not: an empty password
  that reaches it by another route yields an open port, by design.
- An invalid port (outside 1024..65535) or an invalid IPv4 — an error under the
  field, the value is not saved. The Debug API rejects an invalid port and
  protocol. A port outside the range read from storage or a backup is replaced
  with 2080.
- A numeric password stays a string in the config (no conversion to a number).
- A mode change sets the "has tunnel" flag, which decides whether the system
  VPN permission request is needed (see [foreign-vpn](foreign-vpn.md)).
- Any change of the mode or port settings marks "restart needed".
- "Allow VPN bypass" takes effect from the next time the tunnel comes up; the
  value applied in the current session is reported separately from the saved
  one.

## Boundaries

- Registering the port as the system proxy — not done.
- Two protocols on two ports at once — not done.
- Address, MTU, stack, IPv6 of the tunnel interface — template variables,
  [003-CONFIG_BUILD](../../003-CONFIG_BUILD/FEATURE.md).
- Which apps go through the tunnel — [011-SPLIT_TUNNELING](../../011-SPLIT_TUNNELING/FEATURE.md).
- Depends on OS capabilities: the single system VPN slot, the mechanism for
  apps to bypass the tunnel.
