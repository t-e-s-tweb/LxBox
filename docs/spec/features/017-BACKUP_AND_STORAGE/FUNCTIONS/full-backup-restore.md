# Full backup restore — merging or replacing settings from a backup file

LxBox restores settings from a full backup file after a preview, either merging
them with the current ones or replacing them.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Feature | [017-BACKUP_AND_STORAGE](../FEATURE.md) |
| Promises | P4–P9 |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-28 |

## What it does

Brings settings back from a full backup file: shows what is in the file,
lets the user deselect categories and pick a mode — add to the current
settings or replace them. From the empty home screen ("Restore from
backup") — the same in one step, without a preview.

## Parameters

| Setting | Values | Default |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Categories | only those present in the file, with counters: "N server lists (S subs, C custom)", "Routing — N rules, final: …", "N app settings", "N VPN system toggles", "Debug API config (sensitive — token included)" | all present |
| Mode | "Merge with existing (recommended)" — "Adds new items, keeps existing."; "Replace all (destructive)" | Merge |

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** a JSON file; categories and mode; Debug API `POST /backup/import
[?merge=true][&rebuild=true]` (replace by default).

**Outputs:** applied settings; the line "Imported: N server lists, routing
(N rules), N app settings, debug config, N VPN settings", with the suffixes
"(N errors)" and "· N unknown keys skipped"; the "Restart now" button. From
the home screen — "… · fetching subscriptions…".

## Rules and invariants

- **Validation before writing.** Not JSON — "Not a valid JSON file…"; the
  root is not an object; no `app: lxbox` / `kind: backup` — "Not a LxBox
  backup file…"; no `storage` block — "Unsupported backup format. Re-export
  from a recent app version.". All — an "Invalid backup" dialog, nothing
  written.
- **Old form.** A block without the form marker migrates on parsing — before
  the preview and the filter; the migration result and losses go to the log.
- **Replace** is confirmed separately: "Replace all data?" — "This will
  overwrite your current data in the selected categories. This cannot be
  undone." A selected category is replaced wholesale by the file's content
  (a key of the category absent in the file is removed); an unselected
  category keeps the receiver's values (P7, §599).
- **What survives replace** if the file is silent about it: enabling, port
  and token of the Debug API (§413); "already asked" flags of startup
  prompts (battery, tile, update check, notifications). A Debug API key
  from the file wins; the four startup prompt flags are never accepted from
  the file in either mode and are not counted as unknown keys (§600). With the
  category deselected, VPN toggles stay at the device values.
- **Merge:** sources are appended by `id` (an existing `id` is not touched);
  the archive's chains, if any, replace the current ones wholesale, an
  archive without chains does not touch them; vars — by key; other keys of
  the file overwrite their own.
- **Default-deny allowlist** in both modes: top level — a closed list of
  keys, vars — app flags ∪ template vars of this build. Dropped items go to
  the log and the counter.
- After writing — Directions seeding: an archive without them gets the
  template ones and `vpn-1`; running it again changes nothing.
- VPN toggles are applied one by one; a broken key is an error in the
  counter, the others are applied. The UI language from the backup is
  applied immediately.
- A failure of one part (sources, chains, document, Directions) — a line in
  the errors, the rest is applied.
- From the home screen: replace of all the file's categories without a
  preview, then re-reading the sources and a forced subscription update.
- Debug API: the `app`/`kind` markers are not checked; merge — overwriting
  top-level keys wholesale (sources are not appended); the response carries
  `migrated`, the migration report and `dropped_keys`.

## Boundaries

- An LX Backup file is not read by this input — [transfer to desktop](desktop-transfer.md).
- Subscription nodes are not stored in the backup — they arrive with a
  subscription update.
- Importing directly into a set slot is not supported — [018-WORKSPACES](../../018-WORKSPACES/FEATURE.md).
- File picking depends on OS capabilities (on TV — a hint).
