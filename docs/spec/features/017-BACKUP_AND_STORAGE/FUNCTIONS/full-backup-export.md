# Full backup export — saving all app settings to a JSON snapshot

LxBox writes the settings of this installation, by category, to a JSON file that
restores them after a reset or on a new phone.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Feature | [017-BACKUP_AND_STORAGE](../FEATURE.md) |
| Promises | P1–P3 |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-28 |

## What it does

Saves a snapshot of this installation's settings to a JSON file, to restore
them here after a reset or on a new phone with LxBox. The user picks
categories and a save method; the file carries the settings document almost
as is, so new settings get into the backup without changing the format (the
full backup has no format version — it is a snapshot format).

## Parameters

| Category | What is included | Default |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Server lists | All records of the source list: subscriptions, single servers, folders, auto-select nodes, chains | on |
| Routing | Rules, Directions and their migration marker, `route.final`, DNS, split tunneling, VPN/Proxy mode, idle-suspend thresholds, WG build budget, passive check | on |
| App settings | All vars except the Debug API: template vars, app flags (auto-update, language, region, haptics, rotation, subscription request identity including the HWID, automation, Wi-Fi history, config pinning for debugging §037, startup prompt flags); node test parameters, WARP and MASQUE accounts, node sorting and manual order, profiler window, dropping connections on node switch, preset seeding marks | on |
| VPN system toggles | Auto-start, keep on exit, background mode, core log and its verbosity, allow bypass, auto redirect, memory limit | on |
| Debug API config | Enabling, port, token of the Debug API | **off**, caption "Includes the access token. Sensitive — leave OFF unless you know why." |

Save methods — an action sheet: "to file" (system dialog), "to Downloads",
"share". Items unavailable on the device are not offered.

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** category checkboxes; the choice of save method.

**Outputs:** the file `lxbox-backup-v<version>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.json`:

```json
{
  "app": "lxbox", "kind": "backup",
  "created_at": "<ISO-8601 UTC>",
  "source_app_version": "<version>+<build>",
  "storage": { …settings document sliced by category… },
  "vpn_settings": { …VPN toggles… }
}
```

Result — "Saved as … (N bytes)", "Saved to Downloads: … (N bytes)" or
"Backup exported (N bytes)"; the size is in file bytes.

## Rules and invariants

- No category — "Nothing to export — pick at least one category.", no file
  is created.
- The document form marker (`storage_version`) is written with any set of
  categories: without it the backup would be read as the 2.23.2 form.
- The source list travels as a whole with one checkbox, chains — together
  with the other records (§524).
- The category filter works only on known keys; an unknown key goes nowhere
  (garbage cleanup is at the import input).
- Every key import accepts belongs to some category (P2). The reverse is not
  guaranteed: startup prompt flags are exported with "App settings", but
  import skips them silently (§600).
- The `storage` block is absent if it is empty after slicing; `vpn_settings`
  — only when the category is on.
- The file name and the time in it do not depend on the UI language.
- Cancelling the system save dialog — silently; a save error — a line with
  the reason; a build failure — "Export failed: …".
- Debug API `GET /backup/export[?include=storage,vpn_settings]` returns the
  same envelope, but with the whole settings document, without categories
  (including the Debug API); `from=v0_bak` — the 2.23.2-form original saved
  by the migration (for rollback test benches, no button).

## Boundaries

- The backup is not encrypted; where to keep the file is the user's call.
- Not included: core cache, logs, crash reports, rule-set cache,
  subscription bodies (subscription nodes are re-fetched), the built config,
  Tailscale node state, set slots, theme.
- The file is meant for LxBox; for the desktop launcher —
  [transfer to desktop](desktop-transfer.md).
- Saving to file, to Downloads and "Share" depend on OS capabilities.

## Owner's decisions

- The subscription device identifier (HWID) travels with the backup, so a
  restored phone presents the same identity to the provider — by design
  (2026-09-29, audit 591 · 75). Planned: an export toggle "carry the device
  identifier", on by default, for the case of a genuinely new device.
