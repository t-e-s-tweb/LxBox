# DNS rules — which server resolves which domains

DNS rules send specific queries to specific servers before `dns.final`; custom, template and rule
set rules and mirrors of routing rules form one ordered list.

| Field | Value |
|------|----------|
| Feature | [005-DNS](../FEATURE.md) |
| Promises | P4 P9 P11 |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-28 |

## What it does

Decides which server resolves a particular query — before `dns.final`.
Assembles `dns.rules` from four sources into one ordered list and shows the
DNS trace of routing rules and presets as a separate group, where it can be
switched off without touching the route.

## Parameters

| Kind | Source | What can be done |
|---|---|---|
| Custom rule | user: name + sing-box DNS rule body (JSON) | add, edit, on/off, move, delete (with confirmation) |
| Template | the template's `dns_options.rules` (`name`, `enabled_default`) | on/off, move |
| By rule-set (`.srs`) | record from import / Debug API (the UI does not create them) | on/off, move |
| Preset mirror | `dns_rules` of an active preset | the preset's DNS toggle (`dns_enable`) |
| Routing rule mirror | the rule's DNS option: server and/or Force IPv4 | DNS and Force IPv4 toggles |

Currently the template carries no DNS rules of its own (`rules: []`):
everything that did not match goes to `dns.final`.

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** rule records, template rules, `dns_rules` of active presets,
routing rules with a DNS option, paths of downloaded `.srs`, the list of
actually emitted servers.
**Outputs:** `dns.rules[]`; for rule-set rules — local sets
(`type: local`, `format: binary`) in `route.rule_set`.

## Rules and invariants

- The order of `dns.rules` = the list order. New preset mirrors are inserted
  before the template block, new template rules — at the end; the user's
  saved order does not change.
- Mirrors of presets and rules are one atomic group ("From routing rules ·
  ordered as in Routing") in routing rule order. Custom rules are placed
  above or below the group as a whole, not inside it. The group's anchor is
  the position of the first preset record; without one — before the template
  rules; otherwise — at the end.
- A routing rule mirror is built only if the rule is enabled and contains no
  ports, protocols or `network` (they do not exist at DNS query time). The
  chosen server is given by tag; Force IPv4 produces a separate rule
  `{ip_version: 6, action: predefined, rcode: NOERROR}` and goes first. For
  an inline rule the match moves into a shared headless rule-set, for `.srs`
  — a reference to the same set.
- A mirror pointing to a server absent from the built list is silently not
  emitted (no warning). A server dropped because of its channel — the
  opposite: a rule pointing to it becomes `action: reject`.
- A disabled preset (routing off) gives no DNS rules; the preset's record in
  the list is only the group's position anchor and has no on/off of its own
  (a preset's DNS is switched by its DNS toggle).
- A rule-set rule without a downloaded file, and a custom or rule-set rule
  without `server` or pointing to a server absent from the built list, is
  left out of the config with the build warning `template_fragment_dropped`
  (`reason` — `rule_set` or `server`). Rules without a server (`reject`,
  `predefined`) are not checked.
- Custom rule: empty name — "Name is required"; body is not a JSON object —
  "Invalid JSON: …"; the client does not check the body's contents.
- If the config contains `query_type` or `ip_version`, the legacy `strategy`
  is removed from all DNS rules (P11).
- Orphans (a template rule without a template, a preset rule without an
  active preset) are removed on screen load and at build time.

## Boundaries

- The routing rule editor with the DNS option and the "DNS" badge on rules —
  [004-ROUTING](../../004-ROUTING/FEATURE.md).
- Import/export and merging of rules in a backup —
  [017-BACKUP_AND_STORAGE](../../017-BACKUP_AND_STORAGE/FEATURE.md).
- The rule editor does not check the server reference: the server may be
  removed after the rule is saved, so the check is at build time.
