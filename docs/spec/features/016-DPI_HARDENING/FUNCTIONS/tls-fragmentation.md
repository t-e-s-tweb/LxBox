# TLS fragmentation — splitting the ClientHello so DPI cannot read the SNI

LxBox can split the TLS ClientHello of first-hop VPN nodes into several TCP
segments or TLS records, so that DPI does not see the SNI in one packet.

## What it does

Cuts the ClientHello into pieces so that DPI does not see the SNI in one
packet. Two sources of flags: the global checkboxes of the "TLS
Fragmentation" section (for all direct nodes at once) and fragmentation that
the provider built into an Xray subscription (for a specific node). Under
`detour` the decision is left to the core: it enables `record_fragment`
itself when there are no explicit flags.

## Parameters

| Knob | Values | Default | Core key |
|---|---|---|---|
| TLS Fragment — "Split TLS ClientHello into small TCP segments" | on/off | off | `tls.fragment` |
| TLS Record Fragment — "Split handshake into multiple TLS records (try this first)" | on/off | off | `tls.record_fragment` |
| Fallback delay | duration string | `500ms` | `tls.fragment_fallback_delay` |

| Core mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fragment` | ClientHello pieces — as separate TCP segments, waiting for ACK |
| `record_fragment` | pieces — as separate TLS records in one `Write`, without delays |
| both | each record — in its own segment, waiting for ACK |

The `fragment_fallback_delay` pause applies where the ACK cannot be tracked
(in particular under `detour`).

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** the checkboxes and the delay; node bodies after `detour` is set;
the node's Xray JSON (`streamSettings.sockopt.dialerProxy` → `freedom` with
`settings.fragment`; `streamSettings.finalmask.tcp[]` with `type: fragment`).
**Outputs:** flags in outbounds' `tls`; the code `detour_with_tls_fragment` in
the node's notifications; a build warning line.

## Rules and invariants

- The global checkboxes write flags only to outbounds without `detour` and
  with `tls.enabled: true`. The delay is written when any checkbox is on; a
  value the core cannot parse as a duration (`500`, `fast`) is replaced with
  `500ms`.
- Whether the field suits the node is asked of the registry by the body:
  naive — forbidden (the core fails with "fragment is not supported on naive
  outbound"); MASQUE `vhttp: h3` — a conflict, skipped silently; MASQUE
  `h2`/unset — a `tls{}` block is created if there was none, the SNI is not
  lost.
- Flags with `tls.engine` = `apple`/`windows` are removed with the code
  `tls_fragment_system_engine` (the core would reject startup).
- The node's `tls.fragment` under a `detour` assigned by the build (a chain,
  the source's "Add detour") is removed with the code
  `detour_with_tls_fragment` (info); the delay is removed if
  `record_fragment` is not set. An explicit `record_fragment` under `detour`
  stays. A `detour` written inside the input sing-box JSON does not trigger
  the relation.
- On an authored JSON body `tls.fragment` is not removed: the code is marked
  "(not applied)".
- Xray `dialerProxy` → `freedom` with `fragment` and `finalmask.tcp` with
  `type: fragment` yield `tls.fragment: true` (not `record_fragment`), if TLS
  is enabled and the node does not go through a proxy hop; `freedom` is not
  counted as a hop. `packets`, `length`, `delay`, `maxSplit` are dropped
  without a code; both forms at once — one flag. On hysteria/hysteria2 the
  entry has no effect. Other `type` values in `finalmask.tcp[]` —
  `json_field_unknown`.
- REALITY nodes are fragmented like any other node (core ≥ `v1.14.1-lx.4`;
  earlier the flag was silently ignored).

- All three settings are portable: they go into the cross-platform backup.

## Boundaries

- Node ping and probe build their own config, but apply the same global
  checkboxes and the same delay as the tunnel, so the ping checks the path the
  traffic takes; the node's `tls.fragment` under the probe's `detour` is
  removed the same way, but without a code.

- Skipping chain links and `strip_evasion` —
  [006-DETOUR_AND_BALANCE](../../006-DETOUR_AND_BALANCE/FEATURE.md).
- QUIC Initial fragmentation in WARP — [015-WARP](../../015-WARP/FEATURE.md).
- Fragmentation under `detour` cannot be turned off entirely: the core does
  not distinguish an explicit `record_fragment: false` from "not set".
- Xray size and delay parameters are not emulated: the core chooses the cut
  points itself by the SNI labels.
