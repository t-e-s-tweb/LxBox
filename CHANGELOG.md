## [Unreleased]

---

## [2.25.10] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- **Tailscale in the node row ([task 608](docs/spec/tasks/608-tailscale-exit-node-in-node-row.md)).**
  With the VPN on, a node with an exit node reads `tailscale·via <device>`;
  an offline exit device shows `exit offline` in orange instead of the
  endpoint state. Less than 7 days before the device key expires, the row
  warns `key expires Nd` / `key expired` (on a NETWORKS row — instead of
  `running`). Direct vs relay stays in the Network tab: the core's status
  carries no path ([#155](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/155)).
- **Catalogue of public subscription sources ([task 602](docs/spec/tasks/602-public-sources-catalog.md)),**
  EN+RU, linked from the README.

### Changed

- **A hop chain has one name, its tag ([task 594](docs/spec/tasks/594-chain-label-removed-tag-only.md)).**
  The separate label is gone: the Direction filter and the editor title use
  the same name the user sees.
- **The `connecting` timeout grows with the node count ([task 596](docs/spec/tasks/596-connecting-timeout-scales-with-nodes.md)):**
  `max(15 s, 0.1 s × N)` plus a margin for endpoints. A subscription of
  ~230 nodes no longer has its tunnel killed right after the core started it.
- **Ping and probe apply TLS fragmentation and mixed-case SNI** the same way
  the tunnel does ([task 606](docs/spec/tasks/606-audit-591-export-list-tun-warp-dpi-bugs.md)).

### Fixed

- **Nodes and parsing.** Saving an INI source (WireGuard/AWG) is no longer
  taken for a JSON array ([594](docs/spec/tasks/594-ini-source-save-invalid-json.md));
  a whole number written as `0.0` is emitted as an integer ([595](docs/spec/tasks/595-integral-float-emitted-as-int.md));
  `max_concurrency: "0"` counts as unset and raises no `field_conflict` ([597](docs/spec/tasks/597-xmux-conflict-false-on-zero-string.md));
  empty fields of a v2rayN container count as absent keys ([598](docs/spec/tasks/598-vmess-empty-fields-no-warnings.md)).
- **Backup.** «Replace all» replaces only the selected categories instead of
  the whole settings document ([599](docs/spec/tasks/599-backup-replace-per-category.md));
  startup-prompt flags are not reported as unknown keys ([600](docs/spec/tasks/600-backup-startup-prompt-flags-not-unknown.md));
  replacing a backup keeps the VPN toggle mirror ([607](docs/spec/tasks/607-l10n-backup-shell-bugs-from-591.md)).
- **Routing.** A rule whose rule set is not downloaded yet stays on ([601](docs/spec/tasks/601-routing-missing-srs-keeps-enabled.md)).
- **Subscriptions and own servers ([task 603](docs/spec/tasks/603-subscription-and-own-server-bugs.md)).**
  Changing a subscription URL keeps nodes and cache until the first
  successful update; a file subscription applies import rules to its
  snapshot and its Source tab reads the cache; a broken own-server source is
  not saved; deleting an own server asks «Delete server?»; a negative
  `profile-update-interval` from the server is rejected; one request per URL
  per pass.
- **DNS and config build ([task 604](docs/spec/tasks/604-dns-build-health-directions-bugs.md)).**
  Editing SNI of a DNS server keeps the other `tls` fields; a custom DNS rule
  pointing to a missing server is dropped with a code; the proxy port is
  checked on load from storage and backup; «config outdated» fires for every
  template variable; Direction `pool_tolerance` is clamped to the core
  limit 15000.
- **Service, automation, profiler ([task 605](docs/spec/tasks/605-service-live-automation-workspaces-bugs.md)).**
  A start error gets its own notification; a core failure after an accepted
  `SWITCH_NODE` reports `VPN_ERROR(switch_failed)`; automation commands
  resync with storage on start, after a backup and on a workspace switch;
  the profiler reconnects on every tunnel start, START clears connection
  snapshots (no false `tcpClose`), the «DNS / router events off» banner is
  gone.
- **Node list, WARP, anti-DPI ([task 606](docs/spec/tasks/606-audit-591-export-list-tun-warp-dpi-bugs.md)).**
  «Copy link» on a node without a link says so instead of doing nothing;
  dragging under a filter keeps hidden nodes in place; a custom WARP
  endpoint is checked as `host:port` before registration; an invalid TLS
  fragmentation pause is replaced with 500 ms.
- **Localisation and shell ([task 607](docs/spec/tasks/607-l10n-backup-shell-bugs-from-591.md)).**
  More strings go through translation (node copy, theme, About, Add tile,
  restore summary); the core locale follows the saved app language from
  process start; the read-only code editor offers no Cut/Paste.

### Internal

- Contract 1.1.108 (registry texts only); `sync_contract --to` writes the
  full commit sha to the lock.
- Dead code found by audit 591 removed ([task 593](docs/spec/tasks/593-remove-dead-code-after-audit-591.md));
  no user-visible change.

## [2.25.9] — 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **Core `v1.14.2-lx.11`.** Tailscale: a node with a direct UDP path to a peer
  passes traffic to it again (before, TCP connections to the peer timed out;
  SPEC 112, lx.10); the channel to the coordination server always uses HTTPS
  on port 443, so DPI that freezes port 80 no longer cuts the node off the
  coordination server for ~15 minutes after start (SPEC 111, lx.9).
  Sync with sing-box `stable` (lx.11): stricter bounds checks of incoming
  protocol data, UDP checksum 0 written as `0xffff` by the TUN stack.

- **Repeated servers in a subscription ([task 589](docs/spec/tasks/589-duplicates-collapsed-on-survivor.md)).**
  Merged repeats of one server no longer go to `dropped[]` with the per-app
  code `duplicate`: the node that stays gets the registry code
  `duplicates_collapsed` (info, `count`, `names`), both for body dedup and for
  server ownership in an Xray array. The subscription summary shows
  «M duplicates merged into K nodes» separately from «entries dropped».
  Contract 1.1.102.

- **Preset rules without conditions ([task 588](docs/spec/tasks/588-preset-rule-unconditional-and-dangling-dns-rule-set.md)).**
  A preset rule written without conditions goes into the config with
  `template_rule_unconditional`; a rule whose conditions were removed by a
  failure (a variable without a value or an undeclared name, all `rule_set`
  references dangling) is dropped with `template_fragment_dropped`. Sub-rules
  of a logical rule are judged the same way at any depth. Your own DNS rule
  with every `rule_set` dangling is dropped with `template_fragment_dropped`;
  an `.srs` DNS rule without a cached file is reported instead of skipped.
  Contract 1.1.100, 1.1.101, 1.1.103, 1.1.107.

- **`required` of a preset variable defaults to `false`**, as in the launcher;
  the template's 54 required variables say `true` explicitly.

- **Xray JSON arrays with a balancer (§322).** Servers of a pool are named
  `remarks tag`, a taken name gets the server's number in the pool; pool
  members are chosen by the balancer's `selector` (tag prefix), servers it does
  not pick stay separate nodes; group members in the parse result are labels;
  `leastLoad` without `expected` maps to fastest selection; a group points to
  the surviving node after ownership merge. Contract 1.1.104–1.1.107.

- **The contract copy `app/contract/` is committed**, so CI runs the parsing
  corpus and the schema checks.

---

## [2.25.8] — 2026-09-28

### Added

- **OpenVPN endpoints as sing-box JSON ([task 586](docs/spec/tasks/586-endpoint-types-from-registry.md)).**
  A node of type `openvpn-client` is now a known type: it is accepted as your
  own record, inside a document with other nodes and from a subscription,
  without the «Unknown node type» notice. The body goes to the core as
  written into `endpoints[]`; the app does not check its fields. There is no
  form and no `.ovpn` import. Which types are endpoints now comes from the
  contract registry (1.1.99), not from a list in the app.

- **Nodes of a type the app does not know ([task 585](docs/spec/tasks/585-unknown-node-type-accepted.md)).**
  A sing-box node of a type the app has no model and the registry has no
  record for is accepted when added by hand (Add server, paste, file,
  folder member, node editor). It goes to the core as written and gets one
  info notice «Unknown node type»; subscriptions still drop such entries.
  Pasted JSON with `//` and `/* */` comments is accepted too: the comments are
  removed from the saved source, and the app says «Comments were removed.»

- **Home: press back twice to exit ([task 583](docs/spec/tasks/583-home-back-press-twice-to-exit.md)).**
  On Home the first back press shows «Press back again to exit»; a second
  press within 2 seconds closes the app as before. An open side menu, dialog
  or sheet is closed by back as before. On Android 13+ the predictive back
  gesture no longer plays the closing animation on the first press.
- **Tailscale node: Network tab ([task 581](docs/spec/tasks/581-tailscale-network-tab.md)).**
  The screen of a Tailscale node gets a Network tab: node state, sign in and
  log out, this device, the network's devices with a ping, and the exit node
  list. Picking an exit node switches it on the fly without touching the
  node; Save choice writes it into the node. Diagnostics no longer offers the
  external-URL check on a node without an exit.

- **DNS cache settings ([task 580](docs/spec/tasks/580-dns-cache-settings.md)).**
  The DNS screen gets three settings next to Clear DNS cache: `DNS cache size`
  (entries, 1024..65535, default 4000), `Serve stale answers` (answer from cache
  at once and refresh in the background, on by default) and `Keep DNS cache
  after restart` (the cache is stored in `cache.db`, on by default). The config
  gets `dns.cache_capacity`, `dns.optimistic` and
  `experimental.cache_file.store_dns`. Existing installs get the defaults; the
  three settings travel in backups. Contract 1.1.97.

- **NETWORKS on Home ([task 579](docs/spec/tasks/579-networks-pseudo-direction.md)).**
  A Tailscale node without an exit node is in no Direction, so Home did not show it.
  While the VPN is on, such nodes are now listed under `NETWORKS`, the last entry of
  the Direction list. A tap opens the node screen; instead of a delay the row shows the
  node state from the core: `running`, `sign-in needed`, `stopped` or `starting`.
  The config does not change.
- **Tailscale preset ([§578](docs/spec/tasks/578-tailscale-preset-template-for-each.md)).**
  The new routing preset `Tailscale networks`, on by default, serves every
  Tailscale node in the config, subscription nodes included: tailnet names go
  to the node's own DNS, and addresses and names the node claims as its own
  (`preferred_by`) go through the node. Existing installs get the preset once;
  deleting it keeps it deleted. The preset row on the Routing and DNS screens
  lists the nodes it serves.
- **Skip presets on a node ([§578](docs/spec/tasks/578-tailscale-preset-template-for-each.md)).**
  A server or a folder member can opt out of presets that serve nodes one by
  one: the `Skip presets` switch on the node screen, stored as `skip_presets`
  in the record and in backups. The switch shows up only when the template has
  such a preset for the node's type.
- **Template language: `for_each`, `@node`, `#tpl` ([§578](docs/spec/tasks/578-tailscale-preset-template-for-each.md)).**
  A preset can repeat its rules and DNS servers for every matching node, read
  the node's tag, record and body, and build strings such as `<node>-dns`.

### Changed

- **Core `v1.14.2-lx.8`.** Synced with sing-box `stable`: idle connections of
  nodes and DNS servers nothing refers to any more are closed; WireGuard,
  AmneziaWG and MASQUE inside another tunnel really allow fragmentation of the
  outer UDP datagram on Android (the kernel kept DF and dropped oversized
  datagrams); Hysteria, Hysteria2 and TUIC no longer allow it by default.
  MASQUE no longer hangs without an error: `vhttp: auto` goes back to h3 when
  the remembered h2 stops working, closing an h2 tunnel does not wait for a
  stalled write, and an h3 endpoint that never answers no longer holds the
  dial. From lx.6: an XHTTP node without an `xmux` section (or with
  an empty one) now keeps at most three connections to the server and shares
  them between streams; before, every stream opened a new TLS connection,
  dozens to hundreds of parallel connections to one IP on a phone, the
  pattern reported to be cut on mobile networks in Russia (sing-box-lx#32,
  follows the Xray-core default). An `xmux` section with at least one field
  set is taken as written, as before. The core's `sing-box schema` command
  works again (sing-box-lx#30); the app does not use it.
- **Default emoji of a Tailscale node is 🕸️.** It was 🪢. New nodes get the new
  emoji; tags of existing nodes do not change.

- **A hand-written node the core would reject is dropped ([task 582](docs/spec/tasks/582-authored-body-go-dart-parity.md)).**
  A TUIC node whose `uuid` is not a UUID, or a WireGuard node with invalid peer
  `allowed_ips`, is now dropped when parsed, with the reason in the list of
  dropped nodes. A REALITY `short_id` longer than 16 characters is removed.
  A MASQUE body without keys is now read instead of being rejected as unsupported.
  A hand-written REALITY block with an invalid `public_key` is removed whole, as on a
  subscription body, with a single `reality_pbk_invalid` warning.
- **A node written by hand goes to the core as written ([§577](docs/spec/tasks/577-authored-json-registry-reports-only.md)).**
  A sing-box JSON node saved as an own server or a folder member is no longer
  fixed by the app's rules: an extra key, an AmneziaWG `mtu` above 1280, a
  `tls.fragment` next to a detour stay as written. The node card still lists
  each rule, says the app changed nothing, and gives the cause and what to do.
  Rules the core cannot start with (an unsupported `flow`, an invalid port,
  TLS fields `naive` does not take) are still applied. The build report marks
  such lines `not applied`; the Debug API gives `applied` on each warning.
- **A node's source keeps the node only ([§576](docs/spec/tasks/576-node-source-is-bare-body.md)).**
  Saving a sing-box document or an array in the node editor keeps the first
  node (not a service outbound and not a group) or the first element, and says
  once that the rest of the input is not kept. A document with no such node is
  refused. Records saved earlier with a document or an array are read as the
  node's body; the config stays the same. The same sing-box JSON inside a
  subscription no longer keeps an AmneziaWG `mtu` above 1280: the exemption is
  for bodies written by hand as an own server or a folder member.
- **Internal.** Contract synced to 1.1.99.

### Removed

- **Node sections ([§575](docs/spec/tasks/575-remove-node-sections.md)).**
  A node no longer carries route rules or DNS records of its own. The
  Tailscale bundle a node used to carry is now served by the `Tailscale
  networks` preset instead ([§578](docs/spec/tasks/578-tailscale-preset-template-for-each.md)).
  A stored record or a backup with a leftover `sections` field is read
  without error and the field is dropped.

---

## [2.25.7] — 2026-09-27

### Added

- **TLS fragmentation from Xray `finalmask.tcp` ([§573](docs/spec/tasks/573-xray-finalmask-tcp-fragment.md)).**
  An Xray node that sets ClientHello fragmentation in
  `streamSettings.finalmask.tcp` (an item with `type: fragment`) now gets the
  core's `tls.fragment`. These fields used to be ignored, and the node went out
  without fragmentation. The Xray parameters (`length`, `delay`, `maxSplit`)
  are not carried over: the core splits the ClientHello at the domain labels
  of the SNI. The older form (a `freedom` outbound through `dialerProxy`,
  [§488](docs/spec/tasks/488-xray-dialer-proxy-freedom-fragment.md)) worked
  before and is unchanged. Contract 1.1.83.

### Changed

- **TLS fragmentation yields to a hop ([§574](docs/spec/tasks/574-tls-fragment-yields-to-detour.md)).**
  When the build sends a node through another node (a chain, or a
  subscription's detour), `tls.fragment` is removed from it, together with an
  orphaned `fragment_fallback_delay`, and the node gets the info notice
  `detour_with_tls_fragment`. Under a hop the core cannot wait for a segment's
  ACK and sleeps 500 ms after each one, and the explicit flag turns off the
  core's own `record_fragment` default. This also applies to nodes whose
  sing-box JSON sets `tls.fragment`. A `detour` written in the sing-box input itself does not
  count: it never reaches the core. The same rule runs in probe configs.
  Contract 1.1.84.
- **TLS fragmentation with a system TLS engine ([§574](docs/spec/tasks/574-tls-fragment-yields-to-detour.md)).**
  With `tls.engine` set to `apple` or `windows`, `fragment` and
  `record_fragment` are removed with the warning `tls_fragment_system_engine`
  instead of the config failing to start. The engine stays. These engines are
  not used on Android.
- **Node notifications are grouped by code ([§572](docs/spec/tasks/572-notifications-group-by-code.md)).**
  Within a level, notifications that share a code become one entry with a
  count, the list of fields and a single explanation. A code that occurs once
  and notifications without a code are shown as before.
- **Internal.** Contract synced to 1.1.84. GitHub Actions moved to Node 24
  (`upload-artifact`/`download-artifact` v7, `setup-java` v6,
  `action-gh-release` v3). No behaviour change.

### Fixed

- **Fewer "field not read" notifications on Xray nodes ([§573](docs/spec/tasks/573-xray-finalmask-tcp-fragment.md)).**
  An empty `tcpSettings` object and `mode` / `path` / `host` inside
  `xhttpSettings.extra` (and `splithttpSettings.extra`) no longer produce
  `json_field_unknown`. Xray always overrides those three with the outer
  values, so they are read and dropped without a code.

## [2.25.6] — 2026-09-26

### Added

- **Rules left without conditions are dropped ([§571](docs/spec/tasks/571-rule-conditions-allowlist.md)).**
  A preset route or DNS rule that has no matching condition left after variable
  substitution (only an `action`, or a logical rule with empty sub-rules) is left
  out with `template_fragment_dropped` instead of matching all traffic. The list of
  condition fields comes from the contract registry.
- **Closing the parser and build tails ([§570](docs/spec/tasks/570-close-open-tails.md), wave A).**
  A `vpn://` line inside a subscription list now gives every WireGuard/AmneziaWG
  container of the profile, not only the default one. An `sni` that is a label
  gives way to `servername` before falling back to the server address. A replace
  group whose name is taken by a direction is not built, the source goes
  unfolded, and the build report says so; an empty replace group is reported
  once. A node whose detour goes through a replace group that ended up empty is
  left out instead of going direct. Template DNS servers see every template
  variable. Empty subscription updates keep their skip reasons in the source
  summary, and repeated reasons are shown once.

- **Closing the selector, replace and template tails ([§570](docs/spec/tasks/570-close-open-tails.md), wave B).**
  Template variables with a list of values: a `text_list` with options is a
  multi-select of chips, `options_open` lets you type your own value next to
  the list (an `int` is still clamped), and a `text` with a closed list is a
  dropdown. After a config build with template warnings, Home shows
  "Template: N warnings" with a button that opens the codes. On the node
  screen of a manual (`selector`) group, tap the circle next to a member to
  pick it: live through the core when the VPN is up, otherwise on the next
  build. The pick of a subscription's group is kept next to the subscription
  and survives updates and restarts. The direction editor offers replace
  groups as options; the replace editor warns when the group name is already
  taken by a server, another replace group or a direction. The notification
  sheet names the dropped entry, and the paste dialog shows how many entries
  will be skipped and why.

- **Turn a WireGuard/AmneziaWG node off without restarting the tunnel ([§557](docs/spec/tasks/557-kernel-lx4-wg-endpoint-toggle.md)).**
  Core `v1.14.2-lx.4`. A node's menu has Turn off / Turn on, and the node screen has
  a Node enabled switch. A node that is off drops its connections and refuses new
  ones; the rest of the tunnel keeps running. It stays off through config reloads
  and subscription updates until you turn it on or stop the VPN. In the list it
  shows an orange `off` and a dash instead of a ping.

- **Selector groups keep their kind ([§565](docs/spec/tasks/565F-selector-group-genus/spec.md)).**
  A `selector` group from a sing-box subscription or a backup is no longer
  turned into an auto (latency) group: it stays manual, keeps its chosen
  server and goes to the core as `selector`. In a folder, the group screen has
  a Manual mode with the member list: pick a server there and the config is
  rebuilt with it. The folder list shows the group kind and the chosen server;
  the node screen marks the chosen member.

- **Replace a folder or subscription with a group ([§568](docs/spec/tasks/568-source-replace-fold.md)).**
  Settings of a folder or a subscription have Replace with a group: Manual
  (you pick the server), Auto (picked by latency) or Both (a manual group whose
  first option and default is the auto one, `<name>-auto`). Directions then
  offer that one group instead of every server of the source, and rules and
  the default route can point at it. The setting travels in backups as
  `replace` (contract 1.1.78). The old launcher form `fold`/`fold_tag` is not
  read: import names it as an unknown field.

### Changed

- **Internal: no protocol names left in link parsing code ([§566](docs/spec/tasks/566-scheme-literals-outside-dispatcher.md)).**
  The list of protocol files now comes from the contract directory, per-protocol link parser wrappers are gone,
  and input recognition reads the contract; no behaviour change.

- **Docs only: contract doc `CANON.md` renamed to `PARSING_PRINCIPLES.md` (§72).**
  Internal comments and doc links updated to match; no behaviour change.

- **Node names with broken bytes and old-style VMess links match the desktop app ([§563](docs/spec/tasks/563-form-redetect-and-utf8-series.md)).**
  A run of invalid bytes in a node name (for example cp1251 text in a link label)
  now shows as a single `�` instead of one per byte, so the node tag is the same on
  both sides. Old-style `vmess://` links with `method:uuid@host:port` under base64
  are recognised by what is inside the base64, as on desktop.

- **Dropped subscription entries show in the subscription summary, not on a working node ([§561](docs/spec/tasks/561-dropped-only-in-source-summary.md)).**
  An entry the parser could not turn into a node (unknown protocol, broken fields,
  unreachable relay) used to leave its error on a neighbouring node that had nothing
  wrong with it. Now working nodes stay clean. The subscription screen shows
  `N entries dropped`; tap it to see each reason. The subscription card in the list
  shows the count. A subscription with no nodes at all still shows the error under
  the input field.

- **Chains with a REALITY hop no longer refuse to save when uTLS is stripped ([§556](docs/spec/tasks/556-registry-debt-1157-1170.md)).**
  If a chain strips `tls.utls` and a later hop runs REALITY, the editor shows a warning
  instead of locking the Save button, the strip row reads `kept`, and the build keeps
  uTLS on all hops and assembles the chain. The strip options, their defaults and
  descriptions now come from the contract. The AmneziaWG level next to the protocol
  in the node list (`awg2`, `awg1.5+`, …) is read from the contract as well. A member
  of an Auto group that no longer resolves to a node is logged as
  `group_member_dropped`, one line per member.

- **Node sanitizer catches up with contract 1.1.57–1.1.67 ([§556](docs/spec/tasks/556-registry-debt-1157-1170.md)).**
  REALITY without uTLS now gets uTLS switched on instead of losing REALITY, and a
  `random` fingerprint under REALITY becomes `chrome`, both with a code on the node;
  the build no longer patches this silently. MASQUE keeps `tls.fragment` and
  `tls.record_fragment` on `h2`/`auto` and drops them on `h3`; a body without `vhttp`
  stays without it. AmneziaWG `jmin > jmax` drops both bounds with a code, Tailscale
  `advertise_routes` masks host bits and drops default routes with a code, and an
  object sent where a string is expected (hysteria v1 `obfs`) is unwrapped by rule.
  In an Xray chain, TLS fragmentation from a `freedom` dialer goes to the hop that
  actually dials out, and such a chain is no longer dropped. The global TLS fragment
  toggle asks the registry per node, so MASQUE without `vhttp` gets it too. A
  WireGuard `listen_port` yields to a detour added by the build, with a code in the
  build report. Backups carry an Auto group's warnings as they are; a node disabled
  after a core rejection stays disabled on import, without the verdict.
  A node the core cannot run is now dropped at build time by the registry's
  build-tag and version requirements (Tailscale without `with_tailscale`, AmneziaWG
  3.x fields or a keepalive range on an older core), with its code in the build
  report; the Tailscale gate no longer goes by core version.
- **Template language parity with contract 1.1.68–1.1.70 ([§555](docs/spec/tasks/555-template-lang-spec143-parity.md)).**
  A list-valued `#if` branch inside an array now splices one level into the parent,
  `@runtime.platform/arch/target` drop their key instead of leaking into the config,
  variables accept `options_open`, and template warnings (undeclared variable, unknown
  directive, clamped or invalid number, dropped preset fragment) carry their parameters,
  are deduplicated and come first in the build report without blocking save. A preset
  or template DNS server of an address type left without `server` is now dropped with
  a warning.
- **Link schemes are recognised from the contract registry only ([§562](docs/spec/tasks/562-uri-scheme-dispatch-from-registry.md)).**
  Internal: the parser's own scheme lists and the SOCKS version ↔ scheme table are gone;
  the registry's scheme and alias declarations decide which links are accepted. Nodes and
  their tags are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Wi-Fi rules: the app says why it cannot read the network name ([§567](docs/spec/tasks/567-wifi-ssid-read-preflight-and-diagnostics.md)).**
  Android hides the Wi-Fi name without an error when location is set to
  "Approximate" instead of "Precise" or the system Location toggle is off, so
  `wifi_ssid` rules stopped matching and Add current suggested toggling Wi-Fi.
  Add current now opens the permission dialog with a precise-location note, or
  offers the Location settings when Location is off. The Wi-Fi section of the
  rule editor shows a hint only when something is actually missing, and the
  Diagnostics location row reports precise location and the Location toggle. The
  reason is written to logcat under the `WifiInfoReader` tag.

- **Wi-Fi rules read the network name the way Android 12+ expects ([§569](docs/spec/tasks/569-wifi-ssid-transport-info-api31.md)).**
  On Android 12 and newer the Wi-Fi name and BSSID now come from a network
  callback registered with location info, which replaces the deprecated
  `getConnectionInfo()`; the old call stays as a fallback and is the only path on
  Android 11 and older. Permissions are the same. With Wi-Fi off, Add current
  says "Not connected to Wi-Fi." instead of blaming location permissions. Logcat
  shows which path answered (`source=cache` / `source=legacy`).

- **Imported nodes keep what the provider sent ([§560](docs/spec/tasks/560-xray-body-parse-gaps.md)).**
  Fields the node model had no place for were dropped on import: `multiplex`,
  `udp_over_tcp`, dial options (`connect_timeout`, `network_strategy`, `fallback_delay`
  and others), WireGuard `workers` and `listen_port`, QUIC tuning, extra transport
  fields. They now reach the config as written. Xray nodes no longer get a
  `server_name` the provider did not set, sing-box `socks` bodies no longer gain
  `version`, a VMess link with `aid=0` no longer writes `alter_id: 0`. An Xray
  `socks` outbound becomes a node, and an Xray outbound nobody can read is reported
  as rejected instead of disappearing.

- **Links to a chain open the chain ([§558](docs/spec/tasks/558-chain-owner-navigation.md)).**
  Tapping a chain on a node's screen, or a chain named in the detour-loop sheet, used
  to show "Source not found in your lists". It now opens the chain editor, and a saved
  change rebuilds the config and applies it to a running tunnel, same as in Servers.

## [2.25.5] — 2026-09-25

Патч поверх [v2.25.4](docs/releases/v2.25.4.md): ядро `v1.14.2-lx.3` (VLESS
Vision поверх VLESS-шифрования на любом транспорте, XHTTP выбирает версию
HTTP по `alpn`), ссылки hysteria2 из 3x-ui с gecko без потерь, `flow` у
VLESS с шифрованием больше не снимается, XHTTP с `uplinkDataPlacement`
`body`/`auto` не теряет настройку, узлы sing-box JSON и проверка задержки
проходят через реестр протоколов, разбор подписок и гард реестра примерно
вдвое быстрее, подсветка синтаксиса JSON в редакторе конфига и на экранах
просмотра JSON. Контракт 1.1.56.

### Added

- **Подсветка синтаксиса JSON ([§554](docs/spec/tasks/554F-schema-driven-node-editor/spec.md)).**
  Редактор конфига и JSON-поле мастера добавления сервера подсвечивают
  ключи, строки, числа и скобки; тема светлая или тёмная по теме приложения.
  Вкладка JSON в настройках узла, экран просмотра узла и инспектор узлов
  подписки показывают JSON тем же просмотрщиком с подсветкой (только
  чтение). Библиотека подсветки — `re_highlight`.

### Fixed

- **Ссылки hysteria2 из 3x-ui с gecko больше не теряют размеры пакетов ([§543](docs/spec/tasks/543-hysteria2-3xui-gecko-aliases.md)).**
  3x-ui пишет диапазон gecko-обфускации парой `minPacketSize`/`maxPacketSize`
  (написание v2rayN) и `security=tls` в каждой ссылке. Раньше все три
  параметра шли в «не прочитан», узел поднимался с gecko, но размеры из панели
  терялись и ядро брало свой дефолт. Теперь размеры доезжают до `obfs`,
  `security=tls` принимается молча, иное значение `security` узел не ломает и
  отмечается предупреждением. Контракт 1.1.54.
- **VLESS с Vision и VLESS Encryption поверх xhttp больше не теряет `flow` ([§544](docs/spec/tasks/544-vless-vision-xhttp-with-encryption.md)).**
  Узел с `flow=xtls-rprx-vision`, транспортом (xhttp и др.) и постквантовым
  `encryption` приезжал без `flow`, и сервер с Vision рвал соединение. С
  шифрованием Vision работает поверх его слоя, и транспорт ему не мешает;
  теперь `flow` у таких узлов остаётся, без шифрования гасится по-прежнему.
  Нужно ядро с поддержкой Vision поверх шифрования (sing-box-lx#29). Контракт
  1.1.55.

- **Узлы из sing-box JSON строятся по очищенной реестром записи ([§545](docs/spec/tasks/545-singbox-json-entries-through-registry-sanitizer.md)).**
  Ссылки и Xray-конфиги давно проходили через санитайзер реестра протоколов,
  а узлы sing-box JSON (подписка, редактор JSON, Smart-Paste, звенья detour)
  строились по записи как есть, и связи полей за реестр досуживал эмиттер.
  Теперь JSON-узел строится по записи, которую очистил реестр: недопустимое
  значение снимается на разборе, а не протаскивается в модель. Исходный
  объект сохраняется дословно — у сервера из JSON в ядро по-прежнему идёт
  то, что прислал автор, бэкап и повторный разбор видят оригинал. У узла с
  мусорным полем может смениться подпись дедупа; эталон публичных подписок
  не сдвинулся.
- **Проверка задержки идёт через гард реестра, как боевой конфиг ([§546](docs/spec/tasks/546-emitters-drop-registry-rule-copies.md)).**
  Раньше probe-конфиг (ping / URL-тест, диагностика узла) собирался мимо
  гарда реестра, и узел с недопустимой комбинацией полей мог уронить
  проверку целого батча. Теперь запись, которую снял бы гард сборки,
  снимается и в probe: такой узел помечается как невалидный с кодами
  реестра, остальные проверяются; узел со снятым detour не проверяется.

- **XHTTP с `uplinkDataPlacement=body`/`auto` больше не теряет настройку ([§547](docs/spec/tasks/547-last-registry-rule-copies.md)).**
  Ядро требует режим `packet-up` только для `header`/`cookie`, а правило
  судило любое значение: узлу с `body`/`auto` дописывался `packet-up`, а при
  явном `stream-one`/`stream-up` placement снимался с ложным предупреждением
  «параметр XHTTP сброшен». Теперь `body`/`auto` доезжают как есть при любом
  режиме, на всех входах (ссылка, Xray, sing-box JSON). Правило для
  `header`/`cookie` и снятие `plugin_opts` у shadowsocks без `plugin` судит
  реестр протоколов, а не код сборки. Контракт 1.1.56.
- **Узел без адреса сервера снимается на всех входах ([§552](docs/spec/tasks/552-develop-red-after-547.md), [§553](docs/spec/tasks/553-registry-expand-refs.md)).**
  Раньше пустой `server` снимал узел, а отсутствующий ключ `server`
  проходил: обязательность поля жила в общей схеме `dialer.common`, и
  ссылка на неё в схеме протокола её не несла. Теперь реестр разворачивает
  именованные ссылки при загрузке, как лаунчер, и узел без `server` (ключа
  нет или `""`) снимается с `field_missing` — на разборе, в гарде сборки и в
  проверке задержки.

### Changed

- **Разбор подписок и гард реестра быстрее ([§549](docs/spec/tasks/549-registry-sanitizer-hot-paths.md), [§551](docs/spec/tasks/551-parse-route-cache.md), [§553](docs/spec/tasks/553-registry-expand-refs.md)).**
  Гард реестра (сборка конфига и probe-батчей): ~63 → ~31 мкс на узел —
  схема и связи полей разбираются один раз, ключ base64 декодируется один
  раз. Разбор ссылки: ~395 → ~147 мкс на смешанном корпусе — маршрут схемы
  и набор объявленных имён считаются один раз на состав секций, а не на
  каждой строке подписки; outbound Xray сериализуется один раз. Замеры на
  хосте (JIT), телефон не мерили; поведение не меняется.

- **Эмиттеры sing-box больше не держат копий правил реестра ([§546](docs/spec/tasks/546-emitters-drop-registry-rule-copies.md)).**
  Фильтры значений (`flow` у VLESS, тип `obfs` и размеры пакета у
  hysteria2, enum-поля XHTTP) и срез uTLS/Reality на QUIC судит теперь
  только реестр — на разборе и в гарде сборки; эмиттер лишь раскладывает
  модель по ключам ядра. Поведение на штатных входах не меняется, но
  правка реестра теперь доходит до результата без правки кода. Последние
  две связи (`uplink_data_placement`↔`mode` у XHTTP, `plugin_opts`↔`plugin`
  у Shadowsocks) сняты из кода в §547 фазе B — их судит реестр 1.1.56.
- **Разбор больше не держит своих копий правил реестра ([§547](docs/spec/tasks/547-last-registry-rule-copies.md), фаза A).**
  `key_share` у Reality, `obfs` у hysteria2 и `encryption=none` у VLESS
  судит только реестр. Поведение не меняется; текст предупреждения про
  `obfs` у узла из sing-box JSON теперь берётся из каталога реестра — тот
  же, что у ссылки.

- **Ядро `v1.14.2-lx.3`.** VLESS-узлы с Vision и VLESS-шифрованием
  одновременно подключаются на любом транспорте, включая XHTTP (раньше
  каждый такой узел падал с `vision: not a valid supported TLS connection`;
  sing-box-lx#29). XHTTP выбирает HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 или HTTP/3 по `tls.alpn`,
  как Xray: серверы только с h3 работают, а `alpn`, который раньше у
  XHTTP-узла молча игнорировался, теперь меняет версию HTTP.

## [2.25.4] — 2026-09-24

Патч поверх [v2.25.3](docs/releases/v2.25.3.md): ядро `v1.14.2-lx.1` (смена
сети без лишних сбросов, GSO-шум AWG ушёл из лога), ленивая сборка узлов
WireGuard/AmneziaWG с потолком собранных туннелей и настройками в VPN Settings,
российские приложения по имени пакета в пресете «Ru internet segment», две
колонки списка узлов на широком экране, вкладка Appearance, дедуп повторов
узла в одной подписке. Контракт 1.1.53.

### Added

- **Ленивая сборка и лимит туннелей WireGuard в настройках ([§542](docs/spec/tasks/542-build-max-setting.md)).**
  VPN Settings → System → WireGuard connections: тумблер «Lazy tunnel build»
  (туннель собирается при первом использовании, по умолчанию включён) и
  «Built tunnels limit» — сколько туннелей WireGuard/AmneziaWG держать
  собранными одновременно (0 — без ограничения, 3, 5, 8, 12; по умолчанию 5,
  как раньше). Оба пункта недоступны, пока выключено «Suspend idle tunnels»,
  лимит — ещё и при выключенной ленивой сборке. Применяется при следующем
  подключении.

- **Сводка per-app в логе в режиме отладки ([§539](docs/spec/tasks/539-perapp-debug-log.md)).**
  При включённом Verbose (TRACE/DEBUG) на вкладке Diagnostics при каждом
  подъёме туннеля в Logs пишется одна строка `per-app:`: режим белого или
  чёрного списка, `allow_bypass`, какие пакеты применены и какие не установлены
  на устройстве. Без Verbose ничего не меняется.

- **Вкладка Appearance в настройках приложения и тумблер двух колонок ([§541](docs/spec/tasks/541-appearance-tab-two-columns-toggle.md)).**
  Тема, язык и «Allow rotation» переехали из General в новую вкладку
  Appearance, вторую по счёту. Там же тумблер «Two columns on wide screens»:
  по умолчанию включён, выключенный оставляет список узлов в одну колонку на
  любой ширине. Переключение применяется сразу, без перезапуска; настройка
  попадает в бэкап вместе с остальными.

- **Список узлов в две колонки на планшете ([§537](docs/spec/tasks/537-nodes-two-columns-wide.md), #134).**
  При ширине окна от 600 dp узлы на главном экране идут в две колонки,
  построчно слева направо; уже — одна, как раньше. Раскладка меняется на лету
  при повороте и split-screen, прокрутка сохраняется. В ручной сортировке список
  остаётся в одну колонку: перетаскивание работает только в ней.

- **Российские приложения идут напрямую по имени пакета (§531).** В пресет
  российского сегмента добавлен четвёртый набор правил — список российских
  приложений `ru-app-list` (автор legiz-ru, ~4 КБ), который сопоставляет
  соединение не с доменом, а с именем Android-пакета. Раньше приложение уходило
  напрямую только если его домен попадал в наборы доменов или его адрес — в
  российские диапазоны IP; банковские и государственные приложения, которые
  работают через сторонние CDN или по IP, промахивались мимо обоих наборов и
  уезжали в туннель. Теперь они опознаются по самому приложению, независимо от
  того, куда оно обращается. Набор включается галкой «Russian apps by package»
  (по умолчанию включена) и скачивается при первом включении, как набор
  GeoIP-диапазонов рядом; снятая галка отключает его целиком, не задевая домены
  и IP. Просили кнопку «отметить российские приложения» в пикере приложений —
  сделано маршрутизацией: список обновляется сам, вместе с набором, а не
  застывает в отметках. Подробности —
  [спека §531](docs/spec/tasks/531-ru-app-list-ruleset-in-ru-preset.md)
  ([#116](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/116)).

### Changed

- **Состояние WG/AWG-узла в списке — одним словом ([§540](docs/spec/tasks/540-endpoint-state-short-label-node-properties.md)).**
  Вместо «Node asleep» / «Node not built yet» строка узла пишет `up`, `sleep`
  или `down` (не собран, разобран или остановлен — ядро поднимет его на первом
  соединении). Полное состояние ядра и время простоя спящего узла — в строке
  Endpoint state на экране Details из меню узла.

- **Ядро обновлено до v1.14.2-lx.1 (§535).** Смена сети (Wi-Fi ↔ мобильная)
  больше не дёргает туннель впустую: ядро сбрасывает сетевое состояние только
  при настоящей смене интерфейса, а не на каждом системном оповещении, — на
  телефоне это меньше разрывов на ходу и в лифте. Ключи засыпания
  WireGuard/AmneziaWG переехали в отдельный блок настроек ядра: снаружи ничего
  не поменялось, пороги из Settings работают как раньше, но старое место ядро
  теперь считает устаревшим и на каждый ключ пишет предупреждение в лог —
  приложение пишет сразу в новое. В ядро также приехали ленивая сборка
  WG-узлов и потолок одновременно собранных устройств — они включены отдельно
  (см. следующий пункт). Подробности —
  [спека §535](docs/spec/tasks/535-kernel-1-14-2-lx1-pin-lx-wg-keys-endpoint-state.md).

- **Узлы WireGuard/AmneziaWG больше не занимают память, пока через них не
  пошёл трафик (§536).** Раньше при запуске туннеля ядро поднимало устройство
  каждого WG/AWG-узла в хранении сразу — около 17,5 МБ приёмных буферов на
  узел, независимо от того, пойдёт ли через него хоть один пакет; на десятке
  узлов это десятки мегабайт ради одного работающего. Теперь узел стартует
  разобранным и собирается при первом обращении к нему, а одновременно
  собранными держатся максимум пять — лишние разбираются. На стенде с
  одиннадцатью AWG-узлами живая память ядра после пары минут работы упала
  со 113 до 53 МБ. Плата — полсекунды-секунда на первом переключении на
  узел. Оговорка: группа Auto при старте проверяет всех своих членов и этим
  собирает их, так что экономию в ней даёт потолок, а не ленивая сборка.
  Настройки у этого нет: поведение включается вместе с порогом засыпания из
  Settings, пустой порог по-прежнему отключает всю подсистему целиком.
  Подробности — [спека §536](docs/spec/tasks/536-lx-wg-lazy-build-build-max.md).

- **Ссылки Copy link приведены к общему формату схем (§533).** Вместе с
  контрактом 1.1.53 владелец утвердил, каким именно должен быть вид ссылки у
  нескольких схем, и приложение к нему приведено. У VLESS в ссылку теперь
  всегда попадает `security` — в том числе `security=reality`: у чужих
  Xray-клиентов отсутствие этого параметра означает «без шифрования», и
  reality-узел, отданный без него, открывался у соседа незащищённым
  соединением. У NaiveProxy порт `443` больше не опускается: получатель,
  который дефолта не знает, теперь читает адрес целиком. У AnyTLS флаг «не
  проверять сертификат» пишется каноническим для sing-box именем `insecure`
  вместо `allowInsecure`. У Shadowsocks ссылка окончательно закреплена без
  хвостовых `=` — так её пишет эталон SIP002. У VLESS отпечаток браузера
  `fp=random` больше не уезжает в ссылку: это значение по умолчанию, и
  называть его явно незачем, а любой другой отпечаток (`fp=chrome` и прочие)
  доезжает как прежде. **Чтение не изменилось ни у одной схемы**: все прежние
  написания читаются по-прежнему, так что ссылки, сохранённые раньше или
  присланные другими клиентами, разбираются как раньше.

- **Пресет «Russian domains & IPs» переименован в «Ru internet segment»
  (§531).** Старое имя перечисляло состав, а состав перестал им
  исчерпываться: кроме доменов и диапазонов IP пресет теперь ведёт и российские
  приложения по имени пакета. Идентификатор пресета не менялся — сохранённые
  правила разворачиваются как раньше, поменялась только надпись на экране
  Routing.

### Fixed

- **Повтор узла в одной подписке схлопывается (§538).** Подписка присылала
  один и тот же AWG-узел дважды — строкой `amneziawg://` и сжатой ссылкой
  `vpn://`, и в списке стояли два одинаковых узла. Теперь из записей с
  одинаковым содержимым узла (без имени) остаётся первая, остальные уходят в
  отброшенные с кодом `duplicate` и пояснением «Duplicate of <имя>». Сравнение
  идёт только внутри одной подписки или одного импорта. В корпусе публичных
  подписок так снимается 13 064 записи из 73 938: агрегаторы повторяют один
  сервер под разными именами.

- **Лог узла AWG больше не завален строками про GSO (§535).** Было: у
  AmneziaWG-узлов ядро на каждую неудачную отправку писало
  `failed to send handshake initiation: disabled UDP GSO`, и лог узла, который
  при этом нормально работал, состоял из этих строк — в поддержку приходили
  дампы, где за шумом не видно настоящей причины. Стало: сообщение отнесено к
  штатному пути (ядро SPEC 101), лог узла читается. На связь это не влияло ни
  раньше, ни теперь — менялась только читаемость лога
  ([#95](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/95)).

- **Подписки Xray разбираются точнее: лишние поля больше не сочиняются, а
  нужные не теряются (§533).** Приложение годами держало поверх общего реестра
  протоколов набор собственных поправок, и часть из них успела разойтись с
  реестром. Было: у узла WebSocket из конфига Xray читались поля `ed` и `eh`,
  которых Xray в этом месте не объявляет вовсе, и узлу приписывалась настройка
  ранних данных, которой у него не было; адрес прокси подставлялся в имя
  сервера TLS там, где автор конфига имя не писал; имя хоста WebSocket читалось
  только из заголовков и терялось, если автор написал его отдельным полем;
  настройка keep-alive с отрицательным интервалом понималась как «выключить»
  даже рядом с заданным временем простоя, и наоборот — одинокий отрицательный
  интервал не понимался никак. Стало: каждый из этих случаев разбирается так
  же, как у эталона. Заодно починена сборка ссылки VMess: узел без транспорта
  уезжал по Copy link **без адреса сервера** — такой ссылкой нельзя было
  поделиться. Подробности —
  [спека §533](docs/spec/tasks/533-contract-1-1-53-sync-overlays-body-runner.md).

- **HTTPS-прокси с `security=none` больше не тянет за собой лишний TLS
  (§533).** У прокси, записанного как `proxy-https://…?security=none`, автор
  явно отключает шифрование, но приложение оставляло узлу блок TLS от
  написания схемы. Теперь параметр снимает его, как и задумано, и такой узел
  уезжает обычным HTTP-прокси — в том числе по Copy link.

- **Движок реестра разбирает ссылки и конфиги по той же семантике, что эталон
  (§532).** Реестр протоколов у нас общий с лаунчером и доезжает байт в байт, а
  исполнялся по-разному — три примитива работали не так, как в эталоне. Было:
  признак «ключа нет» не исполнялся вовсе и считался истиной, поэтому элемент
  Xray с чужой версией протокола (`version: 3`) уезжал в секцию первой версии и
  давал узел, которого провайдер не присылал; признак «тип значения по пути»
  срабатывал и когда пути нет вовсе, из-за чего движок перестал отличать битую
  запись от законного отсутствия транспорта; булево поле без явного объявления
  уезжало в ссылку цифрой (`=1`), тогда как эталон пишет его словом. Стало: все
  три примитива сведены с эталоном — чужая версия ни одной ветке не достаётся,
  форма значения судится только там, где значение есть, а булево без объявления
  пишется словом (цифру теперь даёт только явное объявление). Заодно снято наше
  локальное отступление в опознании Xray-элементов vless и trojan: оно требовало
  у элемента блок транспорта и с новой строгой проверкой отняло бы разбор у
  узлов, где транспорта нет вовсе (plain-TCP) — такие узлы разбираются как
  прежде. Тела и подписи
  (identity) узлов не изменились; из видимого сменилось написание одного
  параметра в ссылках TUIC — `reduce_rtt=true` вместо `reduce_rtt=1`, ровно как
  у эталона (обе формы читаются по-прежнему). Подробности —
  [спека §532](docs/spec/tasks/532-registry-engine-primitives-parity.md),
  основание — ревизия зеркала реестра от 24.09.2026 (§3 п.1–3).

- **В режиме Proxy приложение больше не спрашивает про другой активный VPN
  (§528).** Было: в режиме Proxy (только локальный порт, без туннеля) нажатие
  Start показывало вопрос «Another VPN is active. Switch to L×Box?» — хотя
  соседний VPN в этом режиме не отзывается и выключать его незачем. Вопрос
  сбивал с толку: его читали как предупреждение и либо отменяли запуск, либо
  выключали второй VPN руками. Стало: вопрос задаётся только когда туннель
  действительно поднимается — в режимах VPN и VPN+Proxy, где системный
  VPN-слот один и соседний туннель правда будет отозван. В режиме Proxy запуск
  идёт сразу. Сам вопрос, его текст и кнопки, включая «VPN settings», не
  менялись; поведение при отмене тоже
  ([#126](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/126)).

- **Снятая галка набора в пресете «Ru internet segment» больше не выключает
  всё правило (§534).** Было: галки «GeoIP IP-range fallback» и «Russian apps
  by package» слушала только сборка конфига, а экран Routing, кнопка
  скачивания и фоновое обновление наборов их не видели. Набор со снятой галкой
  всё равно скачивался и обновлялся, у правила висела иконка ☁ ради набора,
  который в конфиг не попадает, а если файла этого набора не было — при
  открытии Routing выключалось всё правило пресета, хотя галку сняли как раз
  чтобы обойтись без набора. Стало: экран Routing, скачивание и автообновление
  решают, включён ли набор, тем же правилом, что и сборка конфига; выключенный
  галкой набор не качается, не требуется в кэше, и правило из-за него не
  гаснет. Файл набора при снятой галке остаётся в кэше, и при возврате галки
  качать его заново не нужно; если файла не было, редактор правила скачает его
  сразу при включении галки. Правило, которое прежнее поведение уже выключило,
  само не включится — его достаточно один раз включить переключателем.

## [2.25.3] — 2026-09-24

Патч поверх [v2.25.2](docs/releases/v2.25.2.md): ядро `v1.14.1-lx.10` (синк с
апстримом sing-box, Диагностика naive без падения, доменные WireGuard/AmneziaWG
за секунду вместо пяти), единый список записей на экране Servers, порог ожидания
старта по числу WireGuard-endpoint'ов, меню редактора конфига и пресет
`dns_shield`. Контракт 1.1.52 — без изменений.

### Added

- **Разбор подписок теперь проверяется на корпусе реальных публичных списков
  (§525).** В репозиторий положены снимки 68 публичных подписок — около 74 000
  узлов текстом, ровно в том виде, в каком их отдают источники, — и механизм
  прогона разбора по ним. Каждое изменение реестра протоколов теперь сверяется
  с эталоном: если число разобранных узлов упало или сменились коды отбраковки,
  это видно сразу и по конкретной подписке, а не после жалобы. Прогон только
  читает текст: ни один сервер из корпуса не подключается и не проверяется на
  доступность, конфиг не собирается, ядро не запускается. На поведение
  приложения изменение не влияет — это внутренняя мера качества разбора.

### Changed

- **Цепочки стоят в списке серверов наравне с остальными записями, а в бэкапе
  едут в серверах (§524).** Раньше цепочка была отдельным механизмом внутри
  приложения: список на экране Servers собирался из трёх разных мест на каждый
  кадр, одно перетаскивание записывало настройки дважды, а в экспорте бэкапа
  цепочки отмечались галкой Routing — вместе с правилами маршрутизации, а не
  вместе с серверами, хотя в списке они стоят рядом с серверами. Теперь список
  один: подписки, серверы, папки и цепочки — записи одного рода, в одном
  порядке; перетаскивание сохраняется одной записью; в бэкапе цепочки едут
  галкой «Server lists». Старые архивы, где цепочки экспортировались как
  Routing, читаются по-прежнему — восстанавливать их надо галкой серверов.
  Заодно Debug API `GET /subs` впервые показывает тот же список, что видит
  пользователь, включая цепочки. Файл настроек, формат бэкапа и сами настройки
  не менялись; узлы, маршруты и порядок списка остаются как были.

- **Ядро обновлено до `v1.14.1-lx.10`: Диагностика узла NaiveProxy больше не
  закрывает приложение, а серверы WireGuard/AmneziaWG с адресом по имени
  подключаются быстрее (§526).** Диагностика узла `naive` при живом туннеле
  закрывала приложение сразу же: ядро читало адрес соединения, которого у
  соединения этого типа нет. Теперь Диагностика такого узла отдаёт статус,
  ответ и время, как у любого другого, а поле адреса остаётся пустым — так и
  должно быть. Трафик через такие узлы и проверка задержки не страдали и
  раньше. Отдельно: у серверов WireGuard и AmneziaWG, чей адрес задан именем,
  а не IP, первое рукопожатие проходит с первой попытки — раньше первая попытка
  терялась и подключение к такому серверу занимало лишние пять секунд. Вместе с
  этим ядро синхронизировано с апстримом sing-box: правки по DNS, IPv6 и
  завершению работы. Схема конфига, набор полей и поведение остальных узлов не
  менялись.

- **Ядро обновлено до `v1.14.1-lx.9`: XHTTP-соединения больше не считаются
  сбойными при переключении серверов (§522).** Когда вы меняли сервер или ядро
  само закрывало уже ненужное XHTTP-соединение, оно принимало собственное
  закрытие за обрыв со стороны сервера: в лог на каждый запрос падала строка
  `ERROR connection download closed: http2: response body closed`, а рабочая
  XMUX-сессия помечалась негодной и пересобиралась заново. Исправлено в ядре:
  локальная отмена теперь распознаётся и не считается сбоем — лог рабочего
  XHTTP-узла чистый, а переключение сервера не обходится лишней пересборкой
  сессии. Настоящий обрыв на стороне сервера сообщается как раньше.
  Схема конфига, набор полей и поведение узлов не менялись
  ([#148](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/148)).

### Fixed

- **DNS-пресет Shield: сервер Яндекса по DoT реально участвует в группе
  (§527).** Раньше он молча выпадал: в группе он был записан, но самой записи
  сервера в шаблоне не было — при каждой сборке конфига участник исчезал с
  предупреждением, и «щит» опрашивал пять провайдеров вместо шести. Заметно это
  было тем, у кого доступ ограничен белыми списками: Яндекс в такой сети
  отвечает, а остальные участники группы — нет, и резолв не работал вовсе.
  Теперь сервер объявлен: Яндекс по DNS-over-TLS, напрямую, без туннеля — то
  есть работает и когда туннель не поднялся, а запросы всё равно идут
  шифрованными, без утечки в открытый UDP. Существующие конфиги не
  мигрируются: состав группы берётся из шаблона при следующей сборке конфига.

- **Проверка на всех серверах больше не падает на списках с несколькими
  WireGuard/AmneziaWG-узлами (§523).** Проверка поднимает ядро, а оно заранее
  резервирует буферы под каждый WireGuard-узел конфига, а не только под тот,
  который меряется в данный момент: около 17 МБ на узел, то есть под 200 МБ на
  десятке. Лимит памяти проверка пробивала — и приложение закрывалось вместо
  того, чтобы показать задержки. Теперь такие узлы проверяются порциями по
  четыре: между порциями ядро перезапускается и буферы освобождаются.
  Все узлы по-прежнему меряются, порядок списка не меняется, проверка просто
  идёт чуть дольше. Списки без WireGuard-узлов работают как раньше.

- **Меню Cut/Copy/Paste в редакторе конфига больше не размножается и не висит
  после снятия выделения (§521).** На экране могло оказаться сразу несколько
  меню — два-три экземпляра друг поверх друга, последний ещё и обрезанный
  краем экрана, — а снятие выделения тапом по пустому месту их не убирало.
  Причина была не в самом меню: редактор заново создавал его управляющий
  объект при каждой перерисовке экрана (индикатор загрузки, баннер о размере
  файла, любое поле в мастере добавления сервера), и уже показанное меню
  оставалось без хозяина — закрыть его было некому. Теперь у редактора один
  такой объект на всё время жизни экрана, а меню закрывается и по снятию
  выделения, и по тапу мимо, и при скролле, и при уходе с экрана. Тап по самим
  кнопкам меню по-прежнему выделение не сбрасывает: копируется ровно то, что
  выделено.
- **Диагностический отчёт о проблемах узлов больше не пропускает узлы с
  одинаковыми именами (§520).** Провайдеры нередко зовут все узлы одинаково —
  например, просто `proxy`, — а один и тот же сервер может прийти дважды под
  разными протоколами с общим именем. В отчёте о проблемах разбора такие узлы
  накладывались друг на друга: оставался только последний, а замечания к
  остальным исчезали. Заметить это было нельзя, потому что число узлов рядом
  показывалось верное: двенадцать узлов — восемь строк замечаний. Теперь
  узлы-тёзки различаются так же, как в списке узлов, и ни одно замечание не
  теряется.
- **VPN с несколькими WireGuard/AmneziaWG-узлами больше не отключается сам через
  15 секунд (§519).** Ядро поднимает такие узлы по одному, 7–9 секунд на каждый,
  а страховка от зависшего старта ждала фиксированные 15 секунд на любой конфиг.
  На четырёх и более узлах она успевала прибить уже установленное соединение:
  рукопожатие состоялось, туннель поднят — и тут же погашен. Причины при этом
  видно не было, снаружи это выглядело как «нажал Connect, ничего не произошло».
  Теперь запас времени растёт вместе с числом таких узлов, а если страховка всё
  же срабатывает — она называет причину и порог, вместо того чтобы молча
  отключиться. Для конфигов без WireGuard-узлов порог прежний.

## [2.25.2] — 2026-09-24

Патч поверх [v2.25.1](docs/releases/v2.25.1.md): основной корпус изменений
(реестр с лаунчером 2.0.0, страховка Start) — в
[v2.25.0](docs/releases/v2.25.0.md). Здесь — подписки, которые приезжали короче,
чем есть: зеркало контракта 1.1.49 → 1.1.52, набор схем из реестра, Workspaces,
редактор конфига, пресет `dns_shield` и проверка на naive-узлах.

### Changed

- **Зеркало контракта 1.1.49 → 1.1.52, и шесть норм разбора стали исполняемыми
  (§514).** Волны закрывают дефекты четырёх аудитов, и класс у них один: узел
  либо терялся целиком, либо уезжал «рабочим» и не соединялся. Что изменилось
  для пользователя:
  - **Баннер провайдера больше не становится узлом-пустышкой.** Панели при
    истёкшей подписке отдают не пустое тело, а синтаксически валидную ссылку в
    никуда (`0.0.0.0:1`, `127.0.0.1:1080`) и кладут объяснение в ремарку после
    `#`; при исчерпанном трафике такая запись бывает единственной. Признаком
    баннера прежде было отсутствие `://`, поэтому человек с истёкшей подпиской
    получал «рабочую» подписку из одного сервера вместо сообщения о том, что
    подписка истекла. Теперь судится ЦЕЛЬ: запись с адресом, который сервером не
    бывает, в состав не идёт, а текст провайдера доезжает до человека причиной.
  - **Узел с транспортом, которого у ядра нет, отбраковывается вместо
    подмены.** `network: kcp`/`quic` уезжал в тело дословно, санитайзер снимал
    транспорт молча, и узел выходил рабочим plain-TCP — сервер, который ждёт
    mKCP, такое соединение не примет, а причины человек не видел.
  - **Обфускация TCP-заголовком (`headerType=http`) отбраковывает узел.**
    Прежде она переносилась в транспорт `http`, а у ядра это HTTP/2 — на проводе
    другой протокол: сервер, ждущий камуфляж, получал h2-рукопожатие и обрывал
    соединение. Узел выглядел рабочим и не работал. У Xray-JSON та же форма
    терялась вообще молча. Настоящий транспорт `http` (`type=http` прямым
    текстом) не затронут.
  - **Пароль socks больше не теряется.** v2rayN пишет socks-ссылку как
    `base64("user:pass")` всегда, а разбор резал строку по `:`, которого в ней
    нет: имя становилось всей base64-строкой, пароль исчезал молча. Одиночный
    userid socks4 при этом по-прежнему читается как имя.
  - **Полоса и `extra` у панелей доезжают.** `up`/`down` у hysteria2 (написание
    официального клиента) больше не теряются, а слой `extra` у vmess читается и
    когда панель кладёт его вложенным объектом — вместе с ним доезжает `xmux` и
    поля `sc*`.
  - **ALPN из Xray-конфига доезжает до тела.** Он есть часть рукопожатия:
    сервер, которому нечего выбрать из предложенного, соединение обрывает, то
    есть узел с h2-only сервером просто не работал.
  - **Xray-элементы `wireguard`, `socks` и `http` больше не пропадают.** Ни одна
    секция их не опознавала, и узел исчезал целиком — при том, что все целевые
    поля у ядра есть.
  - **Выбранный вручную член импортированной группы `selector` больше не
    теряется.** Род группы у нас по-прежнему urltest (ручного выбора нет), но
    само поле доживает в состоянии узла и в бэкапе: прежде круг «импорт → бэкап
    → импорт» терял выбор молча.
  - **Непрочитанный ключ внутри контейнера получает ноту.** Всё, что лежало
    внутри `settings`/`streamSettings` и не читалось ни одной записью, терялось
    вообще без следа — ни кода, ни объяснения. Узел такая нота не ломает.
  - **Вид ссылки socks4 сменился на `userid:@host`** (разделитель пишется даже
    при отсутствующем пароле): пароля у версии 4 нет по протоколу, но
    разделитель клиенты пишут всегда, и его отсутствие часть из них читает как
    «имени нет».

- **Пресет DNS `dns_shield` больше не резолвит открытым текстом (§517).** В
  группе стоял `mode: fastest` — запрос уходит всем членам сразу, а открытый
  UDP без TLS-рукопожатия почти всегда выигрывает гонку у DoH/DoT: «щит»
  регулярно отвечал из открытого резолвера, и запрос по UDP всё равно был
  виден наблюдателю, даже когда побеждал шифрованный член. Из группы убраны
  `google_udp`, `cloudflare_udp`, `opendns_udp` и `yandex_udp`; у первых трёх
  провайдеров шифрованный двойник в группе уже был, для OpenDNS добавлена
  запись `opendns_doh`. Сами серверы `*_udp` остались в списке — на них
  ссылаются подсказки и дефолты резолверов, выбрать их по-прежнему можно.
  Существующие конфиги автоматически не переписываются: новый состав
  применяется к новым установкам и при следующей сборке конфига.

- **Рекомендация Play «Отображение от края до края» разобрана до причины
  (§516).** Своих вызовов отключённых на Android 15 API у приложения нет ни в
  Kotlin, ни в Dart: стиль системных панелей не задаётся вообще. Ссылки, которые
  находит статический сканер Play, приходят из эмбеддинга Flutter 3.47.1 — и там
  все они уже закрыты рантайм-гейтом `SDK_INT < 35`, то есть на Android 15 не
  исполняются. `targetSdk` у нас 36, edge-to-edge включён принудительно, отступы
  разобраны (§429, §448). Кода не меняли: `enableEdgeToEdge()` при targetSdk 36 —
  это состояние по умолчанию, а ссылки в jar-е эмбеддинга он не уберёт.

### Fixed

- **«Проверка на всех серверах» больше не роняет приложение на naive-узлах
  (§518).** Проверка собирала все узлы списка в один временный конфиг и
  поднимала его разом. У naive это несоразмерно дорого: ядро создаёт полный
  сетевой стек Chromium на каждый такой узел, в том же процессе, что интерфейс,
  — список с несколькими naive-узлами упирался в лимит памяти ядра и процесс
  убивало, снаружи это выглядело как падение приложения. Теперь naive-узлы
  проверяются порциями, по одному на конфиг: сессия гасится после каждой порции
  и движки освобождаются до следующей. Остальные протоколы проверяются как
  прежде, одним конфигом; порядок и полнота проверки не изменились.
  Дополнительно в проверке снимается `insecure_concurrency` — в замере задержки
  пул изолированных сессий не нужен, а движки он множит; боевой конфиг узла
  при этом не меняется.

- **Ссылки `amneziawg://` из подписки больше не теряются (§512).** Панели
  пишут полное имя схемы AmneziaWG, и четыре таких строки живой подписки
  исчезали целиком: все их поля приложение читать умело, но список схем
  лежал в коде литералами и полного имени не знал. Набор схем теперь берётся
  из реестра контракта, поэтому написание, приехавшее контрактом, работает
  без правки кода.

- **`vpn://` с голым `.conf` внутри даёт узел (§512, контракт 1.1.48).**
  Под обёрткой бывает не только профиль Amnezia, но и сам конфиг
  wg-quick/AmneziaWG — прежде такая ссылка давала ноль узлов с сообщением
  про zlib, которое уводило искать несуществующую поломку.

- **Полоса и обфускация hysteria2 из конфигов-форков (§512, контракт
  1.1.48).** Скорость, записанную строкой с единицей (`"100mbps"`), узел
  терял молча, а salamander-обфускацию вместе с паролём — целиком, из-за
  чего узел приезжал и не поднимался.

- **Служебные строки панелей больше не выглядят отказом (§512, контракт
  1.1.48).** Команды маршрутизации соседним клиентам (`incy://routing/…`,
  `happ://routing/…`) узлами не являются: у исправной подписки пользователь
  читал пять отказов при живых узлах. Теперь такая строка отмечается
  info-кодом и в списке причин не шумит.

- **Причина непрочитанного ввода называется точнее (§512, контракт
  1.1.49).** Незнакомая схема ссылки и нераспознанное тело больше не
  сообщают о себе словом «протокол»: у первой свой код, у второго — свой.

- **Workspaces: переключение пространства больше не подменяет подписки во
  всех пространствах (§515).** Если в момент переключения шло обновление
  подписок — вручную по ⟳, по часовому таймеру, на возврате из фона или после
  отключения VPN, — экран прежнего пространства успевал записать свои подписки
  в уже загруженное новое. Во всех пространствах оставалась одна подписка,
  последняя обновлённая, и потеря закреплялась на диске. Обновление теперь
  прерывается до переключения, а запись от прежнего пространства отклоняется.
  Уже перезаписанные пространства фикс не восстанавливает — только бэкап.

- **Редактор конфига: выделение больше не слетает при показе меню (§517).**
  Долгий тап по тексту открывал меню через модальный маршрут — тот забирал у
  редактора фокус, выделение схлопывалось в каретку, и Copy уносил в буфер не
  выделенный фрагмент, а строку под кареткой. Меню переехало в оверлей,
  привязанный к редактору: выделение живёт, пока меню на экране, а Cut / Copy /
  Paste / Select all работают с настоящим диапазоном. Затронуты оба экрана с
  редактором — общий конфиг и мастер добавления сервера.

- **Servers: удаление записи из середины больше не сдвигает соседей
  (§511).** Из списка `u1, c1, u2, c2` удаляли цепочку `c1` и получали
  `u1, c2, u2`: запись того же рода съезжала в освободившийся слот и
  перепрыгивала сервер. Слоты `sources[]` теперь сопоставляются по ключу,
  а не по позиции.

- **Страховка Start: узлы-тёзки больше не обрывают прогон (§510 H1).** Два
  негодных узла с одним именем (теги `Dup` и `Dup-1`) выключались по одному
  за нажатие: после выключения первого тег `Dup` доставался второму, и
  автомат принимал его за «тот же узел повторно» — VPN не поднимался. Повтор
  теперь опознаётся по идентичности узла, а не по тегу.

- **Stop во время проверки серверов больше не поднимает VPN обратно (§510
  M2).** Остановка не кнопкой на главном экране — Debug API, плитка Quick
  Settings, Intent API, Tasker/Locale — не отменяла идущую проверку, и через
  несколько секунд страховка сама запускала туннель. Теперь любой Stop её
  отменяет.

- **Servers: перетаскивание работает при нечитаемой записи в хранилище
  (§511).** Если в `sources[]` лежала запись, которую приложение не может
  прочитать, любой drag молча откатывался: строка прыгала на старое место.
  Теперь видимые записи переставляются, нечитаемая остаётся в своём слоте.

- **Лист «выключено страховкой» открывает тот узел, по которому тапнули
  (§510 M3).** При одинаковой причине отказа у нескольких узлов или у
  одноимённых серверов в папке тап по строке открывал экран другого узла.

- **Число в `alpn` или `server_ports` больше не роняет весь конфиг (§510
  M1).** Узел из sing-box JSON с `"alpn": [443, "h2"]` уезжал в ядро как
  есть, и ядро отказывалось стартовать целиком. Нестроковый элемент теперь
  снимается с предупреждением на узле, годные соседи остаются.

- **Servers: новая запись в конце длинного списка больше не под SnackBar
  (§504, §511).** Запись добавляется в хвост, а хвост прокручивался только до
  нижнего отступа — строку с меткой «New» закрывало сообщение о пересборке.
  После добавления у списка есть запас снизу.

- **Servers: подсветка новой записи снимается, если запись удалили (§511).**
  Удаление в течение 7 секунд после добавления (из меню или при обновлении
  подписки) оставляло подсветку привязанной к мёртвой записи, а экран копил
  ключи удалённых строк до закрытия.

- **Профиль `vpn://` с обычным конфигом WireGuard больше не пропадает
  (§506).** Ссылка, внутри которой лежит не профиль Amnezia, а сам текст
  `.conf`, давала ноль серверов без единого слова. Теперь читается как тот же
  файл, поданный напрямую, — со всеми полями AmneziaWG 3.x.

- **«Серверов не найдено» больше не молчит о причине (§506).** Строка
  подписки, чей протокол приложение не знает, ссылка сверх допустимой длины и
  тело, которое не удалось разобрать вовсе, теперь называют причину в списке
  уведомлений — с именем протокола, а не пустым списком. Служебные строки
  панелей провайдера (правила роутинга) по-прежнему пропускаются молча: они не
  серверы.

- **LX Backup: импорт сохраняет смешанный порядок источников (§511).**
  Цепочка, стоявшая в файле между серверами, после импорта уезжала в голову
  списка: цепочки и источники записывались по отдельности. Новые записи
  теперь встают в порядке файла.

### Internal

- **Xray hysteria без порта не даёт ключа пула (§513).** Синоним тега для
  балансировщика подставлял элементу hysteria порт 443, хотя такой элемент
  узлом не становится (порт в секции обязателен). Ключ указывал на
  несуществующий узел, а мог совпасть с чужим, у которого 443 настоящий.
  Теперь как у vless/trojan/shadowsocks: нет порта — нет синонима.
- **Снят неиспользуемый `nodeSpecForConfigTag` (§513).** Главный экран ищет
  узел через `storedNodeOfEmittedTag`; тест переведён на реальный путь.
- **Документация приведена в соответствие с кодом после ревью v2.25.1
  ([§513](docs/spec/tasks/513-docs-after-review-v2251.md)).** DIAGNOSTICS и
  debug-api-reference (страховка через Debug API, `/help`), GUARDS, ARCHITECTURE,
  спеки 472/478/480, дубль спеки 505 слит.

## [2.25.1] — 2026-09-20

Патч поверх [v2.25.0](docs/releases/v2.25.0.md): основной корпус изменений
(реестр с лаунчером 2.0.0, страховка Start) — там. Здесь три правки приёмки.

### Changed

- **Servers: цепочка ездит между серверами и подписками (§509).** Запись
  `kind: chain` в `sources[]` больше не выносится в хвост при сохранении:
  drag на общем списке пишет порядок массива как есть.

### Fixed

- **XHTTP extra: `sessionIDPlacement` / `sessionIDKey` больше не теряются
  (§508).** Xray пишет в `extra` proto-имена, реестр знал только
  `sessionPlacement` / `sessionKey`. Session id уходил в path (дефолт ядра),
  хотя сервер ждал cookie с кастомным ключом. Пока лаунчер не заберёт алиас
  ([#131](https://github.com/Leadaxe/singbox-launcher/issues/131)) — оверлей
  `contract_draft`.

- **Stats → Memory: разбивка PSS снова с цифрами (§507).** После перехода
  на 2.25 секция Breakdown в шторке памяти была сплошными нулями (RSS и
  malloc-счётчики Native heap при этом живые). Источник сменился с
  `Debug.getMemoryInfo` на `ActivityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo`: на
  Android 10+ первый не заполняет категории `summary.*`.

## [2.25.0] — 2026-09-20

> Главное — **сближение с лаунчером по
> контракту**: у обоих приложений теперь один реестр, и разбор ссылки и
> сборка её обратно идут от одной и той же таблицы. Для человека это значит,
> что узел, прочитанный одной стороной, читается и другой одинаково, а
> скопированная ссылка возвращается такой же, какой пришла. Отсюда же
> большинство строк ниже: то, что раньше чинилось заплатой в одном
> приложении, теперь правится в общей таблице и доезжает до обоих. Зеркало
> реестра — контракт **1.1.46**. Ядро **`v1.14.1-lx.8`**.

### Removed

- **Boosty убран из способов поддержки.** Карточка Boosty снята из донат-попапа,
  страниц DONATE и ссылок проекта (`ProjectLinks`). Криптоадреса без изменений.

### Changed

- **Новая запись на экране Servers: прокрутка и подсветка (§504).** После
  успешного добавления источника (поле «+», буфер, QR, файл, визард) список
  плавно прокручивается к новой строке (выше SnackBar пересборки конфига),
  строка подсвечивается и помечается «New»; подсветка снимается по действию
  пользователя, уходу с экрана или через 7 с. При отказе ввода (§500) —
  без прокрутки.

- **Лист «N servers disabled» ведёт в детали узла на вкладке Diagnostics
  ([§498](docs/spec/tasks/498-core-reject-list-navigation.md),
  [§501](docs/spec/tasks/501-diagnostics-notifications-merge.md),
  [§503](docs/spec/tasks/503-core-reject-list-disabled-node-navigation.md),
  [фича 478](docs/spec/tasks/478F-core-rejected-node-auto-disable/spec.md)).**
  Раньше тап по строке открывал вторую шторку с одним уведомлением. Теперь —
  тот же экран деталей, что при тапе по узлу в списке, сразу на вкладке
  Diagnostics (секция уведомлений снизу, под Check/Run; при переходе из листа —
  прокрутка к ней). **§503:** строка активна, пока узел
  есть в хранилище (в т.ч. одиночный сервер после пересборки без него в
  конфиге); шеврон «›»; удалённый узел — неактивен. Заголовок плашки и листа:
  «1 server disabled» / «N servers disabled». Плашка на главном экране уходит
  после Stop или следующего Start (вердикты на узлах остаются).

- **Отказ вставки одиночной ссылки/JSON/.conf на экране Servers показывает
  причину из реестра (§500).** Красная строка под полем без изменений; при
  известной причине сразу открывается шторка с той же карточкой
  уведомлений, что у узлов (тап по строке — снова). Секретные поля
  (`secret` в реестре) в шторке и Debug API маскируются. Debug API
  `POST /subs` при отказе отдаёт `dropped[]` в теле ошибки.

- **Зеркало реестра контракта обновлено до 1.1.46
  ([§493](docs/spec/tasks/493-contract-sync-11146.md),
  [фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Синк с лаунчера `7e2945bf`: нормы merge-append и двойной base64-обёртки
  (1.1.43), стражи CIDR/дробных портов (1.1.44), dialerProxy→freedom fragment
  без предупреждений (1.1.45–46). Двадцать пять оверлеев, совпавших с
  реестром, сняты; расхождения emit и xray-forms остаются в `contract_draft`.
- **Probe-бар подписки: bulk-переключатель в столбец с тогглами строк, без
  подписи «Test servers» в простое (§496).** Переключатель «все ноды» того же
  размера, что у строк узлов; сводка теста по-прежнему только во время и после
  прогона.

- **Элемент Xray-подписки без порта больше не становится узлом
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md),
  дельта `vless_default_port`).** Раньше приложение само подставляло такому
  элементу порт 443 (socks — 1080) и показывало узел, которого провайдер не
  присылал. Арбитром стали исходники Xray-core: умолчания порта там нет ни у
  одного протокола — trojan и shadowsocks отказываются собирать конфиг,
  остальные уходят с нулевым портом и падают на дозвоне. Теперь такой элемент
  отбраковывается, как и у лаунчера, и причина видна в уведомлениях подписки:
  код `field_missing` с именем поля
  ([§484](docs/spec/tasks/484-required-field-drop-reason.md)). Элементы с
  портом не затронуты.

- **Неизвестные параметры ссылки называются поимённо.** Параметр, которого
  нет в таблице схемы, больше не теряется молча и не сворачивается в одно
  общее замечание: узел получает отметку уровня «к сведению» на каждый такой
  параметр, с его именем. Сам узел при этом разбирается как прежде. Параметры,
  про которые реестр знает, что читать в них нечего, отметки не дают.

- **Узел TUIC с пустым паролем принимается — с предупреждением, а не
  отбраковкой
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md),
  дельта `delta480-7`).** Ссылка вида `tuic://uuid:@host` или
  `tuic://uuid@host` — законный узел: пароль в TUIC v5 участвует в
  рукопожатии контекстом, и пустой контекст соединению не мешает. Прежде
  такая ссылка либо исчезала из подписки без слова, либо проходила молча, и
  человек не знал, что учётных данных у узла фактически нет. Теперь узел
  остаётся, а рядом с ним появляется отметка о пустом пароле. Узлы с паролем
  не затронуты: ни их тело, ни выбор узла, ни цепочки не сдвинулись.

- **Шесть предупреждений узла читают текст из реестра контракта, а не из
  кода ([§482](docs/spec/tasks/482-warnings-text-from-registry.md),
  [фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  `ech_ignored`, `ws_early_data_converted`, `naive_padding_ignored`,
  `naive_extra_headers_invalid` и два кода AmneziaWG
  (`awg_header_invalid`, `awg3_field_invalid`) держали свой текст в
  приложении отдельно от нормативного — вторая таблица рядом с общей
  расходилась бы с ней молча. Теперь у них тот же источник, что у остальных
  кодов: заголовок, развёрнутое объяснение, причина и совет приходят из
  `warnings.json`, поэтому правка у лаунчера доезжает до обеих сторон сразу.
  Уровень и адрес поля не изменились. У обоих кодов AmneziaWG сообщение стало
  подробнее: кроме имени поля и написанного значения оно теперь называет
  последствие — ядро откатится на обычный заголовок WireGuard, и если сервер
  ждёт AmneziaWG, рукопожатие может не сойтись.

- **Разбор и сборка ссылок идут от реестра контракта
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Тринадцать рукописных разборщиков ссылок, отдельный разборщик Xray, отдельный
  разборщик конфигураций WireGuard и отдельная рукописная сборка ссылки
  заменены одним движком, который исполняет таблицы реестра. Имён протоколов в
  коде больше нет вовсе: правило конкретной схемы живёт в реестре, общем с
  лаунчером, и расхождение двух приложений теперь чинится правкой таблицы, а не
  двумя заплатами. Для человека это значит одно: то, что прочитала одна
  сторона, читает и другая, а скопированная ссылка возвращается такой же, какой
  пришла.

- **Узел с негодным ключом WireGuard исчезает НЕ МОЛЧА
  ([§481](docs/spec/tasks/481-contract-1111-wg-awg-by-registry.md),
  контракт 1.1.11).** Раньше обрезанный или замаскированный панелью ключ
  (ряд звёздочек вместо значения) ронял узел без единого слова: из подписки
  пропадала строка, и узнать почему было негде. Теперь годность ключей судит
  реестр контракта, и узел уходит с кодом `wg_key_invalid` — с именем поля,
  объяснением и советом. То же правило теперь действует и на конфигурации,
  вставленные готовым телом sing-box: там ключи не проверялись вовсе, и мусор
  уезжал в ядро, где он валит не один узел, а всю конфигурацию.

- **Негодный ключ защиты заголовков AmneziaWG 3.x и слишком короткий паддинг
  тоже называются вслух
  ([§481](docs/spec/tasks/481-contract-1111-wg-awg-by-registry.md)).**
  Коды `awg3_header_key_invalid` и `awg3_padding_too_short` существовали, но
  не ставились никогда — узел просто исчезал. Заодно приложение научилось
  ловить пересечение magic-заголовков `h1`–`h4` (`awg_headers_overlap`):
  такую пару ядро отвергает при настройке устройства и не поднимает ВСЮ
  конфигурацию, а раньше она доезжала до старта незамеченной.

- **Битые параметры обфускации `jc`/`jmin`/`jmax`/`s1`–`s4` снимаются с кодом,
  а не тихо ([§481](docs/spec/tasks/481-contract-1111-wg-awg-by-registry.md)).**
  Прежде соседние `h1`–`h4` о себе сообщали, а эти семь — нет, хотя снимались
  так же.

- **Предупреждения узла стали «Уведомлениями»: уровни, счётчики и
  раскрывающиеся записи
  ([§479](docs/spec/tasks/479-notifications-levels-like-launcher.md)).** В
  списке подписки строка предупреждения показывает короткий заголовок вместо
  полного текста, а сведения (ⓘ) — приглушённым значком: в начале строки
  протокола у узла, которому больше сказать нечего, и в конце строки
  предупреждения у остальных. Имя узла остаётся чистым. Тап открывает
  уведомления: шапка со счётчиками по уровням (`✖ 1 · ⚠ 2 · ⓘ 3`), разделы
  Errors / Warnings / Info, запись раскрывается в путь поля, **What happened**,
  **Why it happens**, **What you can do** и ссылку **Details**. Тот же список — в
  деталях узла секцией внизу вкладки Diagnostics (§501), вместо прежней
  строки наверху, которая показывала одно предупреждение из многих.

- **Приложение понимает ссылки `socks4://` и `socks4a://`
  ([§475](docs/spec/tasks/475-contract-118-socks-version-by-scheme.md),
  контракт 1.1.8).** Раньше такая ссылка не опознавалась вовсе: узел терялся
  как неподдерживаемая схема — ни в списке, ни в отбраковке. Теперь версию
  протокола несёт сама схема (`socks://` и `socks5://` — пятая, `socks4://` —
  четвёртая, `socks4a://` — `4a`): своего параметра под версию у socks-ссылки
  нет ни в одном диалекте, так что схема работает дискриминатором — как
  суффикс `proxy-https://` у http-прокси. Обратно узел отдаётся своей же
  схемой, поэтому ссылка переживает круг «поделиться → вставить». У версии 4
  пароля нет вовсе (userinfo — это userid), но написанный в ссылке пароль
  переносится как есть: годность пары судит ядро. Ссылки `socks5://` и узлы,
  которые уже есть у пользователей, не изменились ни на символ.

- **Узлы trojan, vless, vmess, shadowsocks, hysteria2, tuic, anytls, naive,
  http(s)-прокси, socks и ssh из ссылок разбираются общим конвейером, и
  предупреждений у них стало больше — с адресом поля
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md), шаги 2–6).**
  Внутренняя перестройка: ссылка теперь переводится в карту sing-box
  («маппер»), а годность значений судит реестр контракта — там же, где её
  судит импорт JSON. Раньше правила жили в самом парсере, своей копией.
  Видно это в шторке Warnings: где прежде было «неизвестный отпечаток», теперь
  сказано, какое поле и какое значение вызвало вопрос
  (`tls.utls.fingerprint` = `bogus`), и то же сообщение приходит на узел,
  пришедший телом. У vless адрес появился ещё у семи сообщений — устаревший
  `flow`, мусорный `packetEncoding`, негодный ключ REALITY, битый `short_id`,
  неизвестный `key_share`, отпечаток без гибридного key share, значение вне
  набора XHTTP. У vmess на конвейер переехали обе формы ссылки — и
  base64-объект v2rayN, и старая `method:uuid@host:port`. У shadowsocks
  устаревший потоковый шифр и метод, которого ядро не знает, судит теперь
  реестр: узел на неизвестном методе отбрасывается не молча, а с названной
  причиной. У hysteria2 (и его алиаса `hy2://`) адрес и значение появились у
  сообщений об обфускации — неизвестный тип, обфускация без пароля, размеры
  пакетов не у того типа, — а отпечаток браузера и параметры REALITY, которые
  на QUIC не работают в принципе, снимает теперь тот же судья, что и всё
  остальное. У tuic то же самое получили сообщения о способе контроля
  перегрузки и режиме передачи UDP. У anytls адрес и значение появились у
  сообщений о числе простаивающих сессий, проверке сертификата, ключе REALITY
  и отпечатке браузера; у http(s)-прокси — у проверки сертификата и
  неизвестного отпечатка. У naive, socks и ssh судить в ссылке нечего, и
  предупреждения у них прежние: эти три схемы переехали ради одного
  источника правил, а не ради новых сообщений. Тела узлов, их имена и
  идентичность не изменились — выбор узла, отключения и цепочки на месте.

- **WireGuard, AmneziaWG и MASQUE — включая файлы `.conf` и профили Amnezia —
  разбираются тем же общим конвейером
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md), шаг 7).**
  Последние три входа узла переехали на единый источник правил. Для MASQUE
  это видно в шторке Warnings: сообщение о версии HTTP, которой ядро не знает
  (`vhttp=tcp`), теперь называет поле и написанное значение, и приходит оно
  одинаково — и на узел из ссылки, и на узел, вставленный телом. Для
  WireGuard и AmneziaWG сообщения прежние, а переезд закрыл давний долг:
  замену завышенного MTU на 1280 исполняет теперь реестр контракта, по телу,
  на всех входах — рукописной копии правила в приложении не осталось.
  Файл `.conf` стал полноправным входом конвейера наравне со ссылкой: прежде
  он сначала переводился во внутреннюю ссылку `wireguard://` и только потом
  разбирался, теперь — напрямую. Источник узла при этом остаётся текстом
  файла байт в байт, а имя по-прежнему берётся из комментария под `[Peer]`
  (так его пишет Proton), затем из имени файла. Тела узлов, их имена и
  идентичность не изменились ни у одного из 100 проверенных входов, включая
  узлы Cloudflare WARP обоих видов — и WireGuard, и MASQUE.

- **Подписки в формате Xray разбираются тем же общим конвейером, и
  предупреждений у таких узлов стало больше — с адресом поля
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md), шаг 8).**
  Последний вход узла переехал на единый источник правил: Xray-конфиг сначала
  переводится в карту sing-box, а годность значений судит реестр контракта —
  там же, где её судит ссылка. Видно это в шторке Warnings, и разница здесь
  больше, чем у прочих входов: у узла из Xray-подписки кодов реестра не было
  НИ ОДНОГО. Теперь приходят — с именем поля и написанным значением:
  неизвестный отпечаток браузера (раньше сообщение было без адреса), устаревший
  `flow`, негодный ключ REALITY (раньше REALITY просто молча отключался,
  и человек не знал почему), битый `short_id`, шифр VMess вне набора ядра
  (раньше подмена уходила молча, в лог), значение вне набора XHTTP,
  устаревший потоковый шифр Shadowsocks и отключённая проверка сертификата.
  Имена узлов, их идентичность и источник (JSON провайдера, байт в байт) не
  изменились — выбор узла, отключения и цепочки на месте.

- **TUIC-узел с идентификатором не в форме UUID больше не принимается
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md) шаг 5).**
  Было: ссылка с коротким `uuid` (заглушка вроде `u`, обрезанный ключ)
  разбиралась и уезжала в ядро, а ядро отвечало «invalid uuid» и не запускало
  ВЕСЬ конфиг — вместе со всеми остальными узлами. Понять, какой из них
  виноват, было неоткуда. Стало: такой узел отбраковывается при разборе, с
  названной причиной, и подписка поднимается без него. Узлов с настоящим UUID
  изменение не касается: их идентичность прежняя.

- **VMess-узел на шифре, которого ядро не знает, больше не молчит
  ([§474](docs/spec/tasks/474-contract-116-conflicts-declarant-advisory-bool-dialer.md),
  контракт 1.1.7).** Было: подписка присылала `scy=aes-128-ctr` — шифр, с
  которым ядро не поднимает конфиг вовсе, — приложение молча подставляло
  `auto` и ничего не говорило. Узел работал, но не на том шифре, о котором
  договаривались с сервером, и понять это было неоткуда.
  Стало: подстановка остаётся (без неё ядро не стартует), но узел получает
  предупреждение с названием поля и тем значением, которое прислала подписка.
  Заодно у трёх настроек keep-alive из ссылки (`tcp_keep_alive` и соседи)
  перестало появляться предупреждение «неизвестный ключ»: ядро их принимает, и
  теперь это записано в контракте. Тела узлов и их идентичность не изменились.

- **Уровни предупреждений узла разведены цветом, сведения в списке — значком
  без текста ([§471](docs/spec/tasks/471-warning-severity-display.md)).**
  Было: под узлом всегда висела строка текста со старшим предупреждением, а
  уровни различались слабо — info был серым, как выключенная подпись. После
  §468 и §469 info-кодов стало столько, что текст «делать ничего не надо»
  оказался под каждым вторым узлом, и настоящие проблемы в нём тонули.
  Стало: error — красный ✖, warning — жёлтый ⚠, info — синий ⓘ. В списке
  узлов текстом показываются только error и warning (счётчик «+N more» тоже
  считает только их), а info отмечается синим значком без текста: у узла с
  warning/error — в той же строке перед значком уровня, у узла с одними info —
  рядом с именем узла, и отдельной строки такой узел не получает. Тап по
  строке или по значку
  по-прежнему открывает лист со всеми предупреждениями и их текстами; на
  экране самого узла текстом показаны все уровни, включая info.
  Цвета уровней собраны в одно место (`banner_palette.dart`) и стали
  theme-aware: жёлтый в шапке подписки был плоским `Colors.orange` и не
  считался с тёмной темой.

### Added

- **Главный экран: значок уведомлений у узла в списке Nodes
  ([§502](docs/spec/tasks/502-home-node-list-notification-badge.md),
  [§479](docs/spec/tasks/479-notifications-levels-like-launcher.md)).**
  Во второй строке, перед подписью протокола, показывается один значок
  старшего уровня (✖ / ⚠ / ⓘ) — те же иконки и цвета, что в списке подписки.
  Тап по значку открывает шторку с карточками уведомлений; у Direct, Auto и
  Block значка нет. Уровень считается в presenter один раз на обновление
  списка (разбор + вердикт страховки).

- **Уведомления узла — секция внизу вкладки Diagnostics
  ([§497](docs/spec/tasks/497-node-notifications-tab.md),
  [§501](docs/spec/tasks/501-diagnostics-notifications-merge.md),
  [§479](docs/spec/tasks/479-notifications-levels-like-launcher.md)).** Тап по
  узлу в подписке открывал JSON / Source / Diagnostics без единого
  предупреждения; значок ⓘ/⚠ в списке вёл в шторку, а полный разбор был
  только там. На экране разбора узла подписки и в настройках одиночного
  сервера / члена папки уведомления — секция снизу вкладки Diagnostics, под
  активной диагностикой (тот же список карточек, что в шторке); на ярлыке
  вкладки — точка, если есть что показать (жёлтая, красная при error). Без
  уведомлений секции нет. Тап по значку в списке не изменился.

- **Конфигурация `.conf` (wg-quick) больше не теряет ничего молча
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md),
  контракт 1.1.30–1.1.32).** Три случая, в которых файл читался наполовину и
  человек об этом не узнавал:
  - **Вторая секция `[Peer]`.** Узел — это один пир, и второй в него не
    помещается. Раньше лишние секции отбрасывались без слова; теперь узлом
    становится первая, а об отброшенных сообщает отдельное предупреждение с
    числом секций.
  - **Незнакомый ключ.** Ключ, которого в описании узла нет (опечатка,
    диалект другого клиента, более новая версия AmneziaWG), исчезал бесследно.
    Теперь он назван по имени — по одному сообщению на ключ. Ключи, которые
    управляют интерфейсом и маршрутами, а не описывают узел (`PostUp`,
    `Table`, `SaveConfig` и подобные), ожидаемы в `.conf` и молчат.
  - **`[Peer]` без `Endpoint`.** Такой блок собирался в «узел» с пиром без
    адреса и порта — соединиться он не мог никуда, но в списке стоял.
    Теперь отбраковывается.

- **Вердикт страховки от ядра не переносится бэкапом
  ([§489](docs/spec/tasks/489-core-reject-verdict-not-backup.md),
  [фича 478](docs/spec/tasks/478F-core-rejected-node-auto-disable/spec.md)).**
  Раньше отметка `core_rejected` и выключение, поставленное автоматом, уезжали
  в файл вместе с ручными настройками — на другой машине узел оставался
  выключенным без повторной проверки ядром. Теперь в бэкап идут только
  настройки: узел, который выключила страховка, в файле включён; ручное
  выключение без вердикта — как раньше. Импорт старого файла с вердиктами
  их игнорирует. На устройстве вердикт по-прежнему живёт в хранилище; плашка
  «выключено N» после перезапуска не восстанавливается.

- **Сервер, который не принимает ядро, выключается сам, и VPN поднимается на
  остальных ([фича 478](docs/spec/tasks/478F-core-rejected-node-auto-disable/spec.md),
  [#147](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/147)).** Было: ядро проверяет
  конфигурацию целиком и отказывается стартовать на первом же сервере, который
  не может принять. Один негодный сервер в подписке из пятисот — и VPN не
  поднимался ни на одном; человек видел английскую строку ядра
  (`initialize outbound[3] vless[🇩🇪 Frankfurt]: parse encryption: unknown
  encryption appearance`) и оставался без связи, не понимая, какой из серверов
  виноват и что с ним делать.
  Стало: по нажатию Start, если ядро отказало, приложение разбирает строку,
  находит названный сервер и выключает его тем же переключателем, каким его
  выключил бы человек, а рядом с отметкой о выключении кладёт дословный ответ
  ядра. Остальных негодных вычищает тихая проверка — без туннеля и без сервиса,
  по одному серверу за круг; после десяти кругов приложение спрашивает,
  проверять ли дальше (на большой подписке это может занять время) или
  остановиться. Когда конфигурация чиста, VPN поднимается, а на главном экране
  появляется плашка «1 server disabled» / «N servers disabled» с кнопкой **Show** — списком с
  текстом ядра по каждому. Красная строка на сервере объясняет причину и зовёт
  обратно: включите переключатель — ядро проверит сервер заново; обновите
  подписку — сервер, у которого изменилось содержимое, включается сам,
  провайдер мог его уже починить. Серверы, выключенные рукой человека, не
  трогаются никогда: причина рядом с отметкой и отличает «выключило
  приложение» от «выключил человек». Обновление ядра вердикты не сбрасывает —
  переключателя для этого достаточно. Реальных стартов ядра на одно нажатие
  по-прежнему два, и перед обычным стартом никаких проверок не появилось:
  успешный старт не платит ничего.

- **AmneziaWG больше не снижает MTU молча, а из sing-box-тела не снижает вовсе
  ([§473](docs/spec/tasks/473-contract-115-awg-mtu-by-registry.md), контракт
  1.1.5).** Было: у AmneziaWG-узла `mtu` выше 1280 приложение опускало до 1280
  и ничего об этом не говорило — человек писал 1420, получал 1280 и узнавал об
  этом разве что по скорости. Правило жило числом в коде парсера ссылки,
  поэтому к телу, пришедшему sing-box-объектом, не применялось вовсе: один и
  тот же узел ссылкой и объектом получал РАЗНЫЙ MTU.
  Стало: потолок, набор полей-маркеров AmneziaWG и дефолт 1280 читаются из
  реестра контракта и действуют на всех входах. Узел из ссылки, `.conf` или
  экспорта Amnezia получает ⚠ «MTU снижен до 1280» с исходным значением; узел
  из sing-box-тела значение СОХРАНЯЕТ и получает ⓘ «MTU выше 1280» — тело в
  собственной форме ядра написали человек или подписка, и переписывать его
  приложение не вправе. Подстановка 1280, когда `mtu` не задан вовсе,
  работает как раньше и предупреждения не даёт: это дефолт, а не замена.
  Обычного WireGuard правило не касается — у него потолка нет. Тела узлов из
  ссылок и INI не изменились, добавились только предупреждения.

- **Узел из JSON показывает мусор в своём теле сразу, а не после сборки
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md) шаг 1).**
  Было: узел, пришедший телом подписки или вставленный JSON-объектом, в списке
  выглядел здоровым, даже если в нём лежал ключ вне схемы, устаревший `flow`
  или TLS-поле, которого протокол не принимает. Про такие поля сообщал только
  отчёт сборки конфига — то есть другой экран и другой момент.
  Стало: ⚠ появляется на строке узла при разборе, с указанием поля и значения
  (`totally_unknown_key = whatever`, `tls.insecure = true`). Проверка идёт по
  тому, что прислал провайдер, дословно, а не по тому, что от тела осталось
  после разбора, — поэтому видно и поля, которые разбор снимает молча.
  Тело узла при этом не меняется: в ядро он уходит ровно таким, каким пришёл.
  Узлы из ссылок и из Xray-JSON ведут себя как раньше.

- **Тап по ⚠ под узлом открывает карточку: почему так вышло и что сделать
  ([§460](docs/spec/tasks/460F-contract-registry-bundle/spec.md) W2b).**
  Было: строка под узлом показывала одно предупреждение и счётчик «+N more».
  Остальные было не прочитать вовсе, а у прочитанного — ни причины, ни того,
  что с ним делать.
  Стало: строка тапается, открывается лист со всеми предупреждениями узла. У
  каждого — значок по важности, текст предупреждения и, где контракт это
  описывает, блоки «Почему» и «Что сделать» (списком шагов). Кнопка
  **Details** открывает в браузере страницу про этот код целиком.
  Тексты лежат в реестре и показываются офлайн: наружу ведёт только
  **Details**. Ссылка идёт на нашу копию документации контракта
  (`docs/contract/`), а не в репозиторий лаунчера: там страницы уходят вперёд
  того контракта, под который собран установленный APK.
  Русский интерфейс получает русские тексты реестра, остальные (включая
  китайский) — английские: в реестре два языка.

- **Копия документации контракта в репозитории
  ([§460](docs/spec/tasks/460F-contract-registry-bundle/spec.md) W2b).**
  `app/tool/sync_contract.sh` кладёт страницы `contract/docs/generated/**`
  байт в байт в `docs/contract/` — туда ведёт **Details** с карточки. Своего
  генератора не заводили: страницы собирает генератор лаунчера по реестру, а
  реестр здесь тот же и под тем же `contract.lock`. В APK страницы не едут.
  Рассинхрон зеркала ловят два стража: `check_contract_lock.dart` сверяет его
  с копией файл в файл, тест — что у каждого кода реестра на странице остался
  якорь.

- **Предупреждения реестра контракта появляются на узле сразу при разборе
  ([§460](docs/spec/tasks/460F-contract-registry-bundle/spec.md) W2a).**
  Было: санитайзер реестра работал только на сборке конфига. Про поле, которое
  ядро не примет, пользователь узнавал из отчёта сборки, а строка узла в списке
  подписки молчала — узел выглядел здоровым до попытки подключиться.
  Стало: узел получает ⚠ в момент разбора, с указанием поля и значения
  (`tls.reality.key_share = garbage`). Текст берётся из реестра на языке
  интерфейса.
  Тело узла разбор при этом не трогает: чистит по-прежнему гард сборки, а узел
  в хранении обязан остаться тем, что прислал провайдер. Гейты `min_core` и
  `platform` при разборе выключены — они судят сборку под конкретное ядро,
  которого в момент разбора ещё нет. Если про то же поле уже сказал парсер
  своим предупреждением, второе сообщение не добавляется.

### Fixed

- **Значок уведомлений на главном экране виден после холодного старта, в том
  числе у одиночного сервера
  ([§505](docs/spec/tasks/505-home-node-badge-user-server.md)).** После §502
  значок на главном появлялся только после Start или пересборки в текущем
  сеансе и пропадал после перезапуска, хотя на Servers предупреждение
  (например AWG MTU) уже было. Теперь разбор и вердикт страховки читаются по
  тегу конфига без ожидания сборки.

- **Вердикт страховки снова виден в списке источников
  ([§499](docs/spec/tasks/499-core-reject-source-list-indicators.md),
  [фича 478](docs/spec/tasks/478F-core-rejected-node-auto-disable/spec.md)).**
  Одиночный сервер, выключенный страховкой, показывал только выключенный
  переключатель — без значка и без причины от ядра. Теперь в строке тот же
  значок уровня, что у узлов подписки, подпись протокола заменяется дословной
  причиной, тап открывает карточку уведомлений. У подписки и папки в trailing
  — счётчик узлов с предупреждениями error/warning, вердикт страховки входит.

- **Xray-подписка с `dialerProxy` на freedom-фрагментацию больше не теряет
  узел
  ([§488](docs/spec/tasks/488-xray-dialer-proxy-freedom-fragment.md)).**
  Провайдеры против DPI заворачивают TLS ClientHello через служебный
  freedom-outbound с `settings.fragment` — это не релей-сервер. Раньше такой
  узел отбраковывался целиком, как будто хоп цепочки непригоден. Теперь узел
  остаётся прямым: при включённом TLS молча ставится `tls.fragment`, а
  параметры `length`/`interval` из Xray не переносятся (sing-box их не
  поддерживает).

- **Негодный CIDR у WireGuard больше не роняет весь VPN
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Адрес туннеля вроде `1.2.3.4/64` или мусорный IPv6 проходил проверку и
  попадал в конфиг, а ядро отказывалось загружать его целиком — без связи
  оказывались все серверы, не только этот. Теперь адрес проверяется как
  настоящий IP, а длина маски — по семейству (IPv4 до 32, IPv6 до 128);
  негодное значение снимается правилом поля. Голый адрес по-прежнему
  дописывается маской хоста.

- **Ссылка WireGuard с несколькими пирами больше не выдаёт только первого
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Формат ссылки несёт один удалённый сервер, а эмиттер отдавал первого пира
  и молчал о потере остальных: скопированная ссылка выглядела рабочей, а
  повторный разбор навсегда терял маршрут. Теперь при нескольких пирах
  ссылка не собирается — Copy link ведёт себя так же, как у сервера, у
  которого переносимой формы нет.

- **Дробный порт в JSON больше не подменяется целым
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  В контейнере v2rayN `"port":443.9` приезжал числом с дробной частью, и
  разбор усекал его до 443: узел выглядел обычным, а адрес подключения был
  уже не тот, что прислал провайдер. Теперь нецелое число не годится как
  порт — узел отбраковывается, как и при строке `"443.9"`. Целые `443` и
  `443.0` не затронуты.

- **Сервер, добавленный одним Xray-объектом, больше не оставляет без связи
  весь конфиг ([§455](docs/spec/tasks/455-node-editor-source-json-tabs.md),
  [фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Правило «JSON уходит в ядро как есть» задумывалось для объекта, написанного
  в форме самого ядра, но срабатывало на любом JSON — в том числе на
  outbound'е из Xray. Такой объект уезжал в конфигурацию чужим диалектом,
  ядро отказывалось запускать её целиком и даже не называло виновный сервер,
  так что автоматическое отключение до него не доставало: один вставленный
  объект — и VPN не поднимался вовсе. Теперь дословно уходит только тело в
  форме ядра, а Xray-объект собирается так же, как тот же узел из массива.
  Сверх того, запись без типа в конфигурацию не попадает ни при каких
  обстоятельствах: она отбрасывается с отметкой на сервере, а остальные
  продолжают работать.

- **Заголовок предупреждения называет поле, а не заготовку под него
  ([§482](docs/spec/tasks/482-warnings-text-from-registry.md)).** В машинном
  ответе о предупреждениях узла заголовок отдавался с неподставленным местом
  под имя поля — «magic header {path} not applied» вместо «magic header h1
  not applied». Развёрнутый текст рядом имя подставлял, и одно и то же
  предупреждение выглядело по-разному в двух соседних полях ответа.

- **Ссылка с `type=splithttp` снова получает транспорт
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md),
  дельта `delta480-8`).** `splithttp` — прежнее имя транспорта `xhttp`, и
  ссылки с ним ходят до сих пор. Узел из такой ссылки собирался БЕЗ
  транспорта вовсе — голое TCP-соединение на порт, который ждёт HTTP, — и
  молча: ни отметки, ни строки в отчёте, только сервер, который «почему-то
  не работает». Теперь написание читается как `xhttp`, и такая ссылка даёт
  ровно тот же узел, что и ссылка с каноническим именем.

- **Публичный ключ REALITY в обычном base64 больше не роняет всю
  конфигурацию
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Панели выдают `pbk` то в одном алфавите base64, то в другом. Ядро читает
  только один и на чужом написании отказывается стартовать целиком:
  подписка разбиралась, узлы были на месте, а VPN не поднимался ни на одном
  из них. Теперь написание ключа переводится в ту форму, которую ядро ждёт;
  сам ключ при этом не меняется ни на байт, а значение, которое ключом не
  является, по-прежнему показывается человеку так, как он его написал.

- **Hysteria2 с диапазоном портов и адресом в `mport` больше не уносит с
  собой весь VPN
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  В списке портов узла оказывался не диапазон, а адрес сервера, и ядро
  отвечало фаталом «bad port range» — падала вся конфигурация, а не один
  узел. Теперь элементом списка портов принимается только пара чисел;
  одиночный порт из адреса уходит туда, где ему место. Рабочие узлы не
  затронуты.

- **Подписка в base64 принимается вставкой из буфера, а не только по ссылке
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Тот же самый текст по ссылке читался штатно, а вставленный отвечал «Input
  is not a subscription URL, proxy link, or outbound JSON». Теперь оболочка
  снимается и при вставке.

- **Конфигурация Xray вставляется в любой из трёх форм
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Вставка отвечала «No valid outbounds in JSON» на одиночном outbound'е, на
  полной конфигурации с `outbounds` и на массиве outbound'ов — распознавался
  только массив конфигураций. Теперь понятны все четыре формы, и превью в
  буфере показывает настоящее число узлов, а не ноль.

- **Сырой `+` в ключах больше не ломает узел
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Ссылка, в которой base64-ключ приехал с нормальным `+`, а не с `%2B`,
  разбиралась по правилам веб-формы: `+` превращался в пробел. У MASQUE от
  этого ключ терял первый символ, а у WireGuard узел пропадал целиком. Теперь
  «плюс читается буквально» — свойство самого поля в реестре, а не заплата на
  четырёх именах ключей.

- **Имена параметров ссылки читаются в любом регистре
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  `SNI=`, `AllowInsecure=`, `Type=`, `ALPN=`, `Fp=` — панели пишут их
  по-разному, и всё, что отличалось регистром от ожидаемого написания, просто
  не читалось.

- **`pinSHA256` со списком отпечатков больше не пропадает
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  `pinSHA256=a,b` давал пусто: значение с запятой не читалось вовсе. Теперь
  это список.

- **`insecure` понимается во всех девяти написаниях
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Раньше их знали четыре, и у hysteria2, TUIC и MASQUE флаг то срабатывал, то
  нет в зависимости от того, какая панель выдала ссылку.

- **`preshared_key` в `[Peer]` конфигурации WireGuard больше не теряется
  молча ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Читалось только написание `PresharedKey`; соседнее уходило в никуда без
  единого слова.

- **Копирование ссылки перестало терять поля
  ([фича 480](docs/spec/tasks/480F-registry-driven-mapper/spec.md)).**
  Сборка ссылки шла отдельным рукописным списком полей, и то, что разбор
  прочитал, копия не всегда возвращала: `mport` и `pinSHA256` у hysteria2,
  `plugin` у Shadowsocks, открытый метод SS2022, дополнительные заголовки
  HTTP, IPv6-адрес у VMess, PEM-ключ у SSH. Теперь ссылка собирается той же
  таблицей реестра, которой разбирается, и круг «скопировать → вставить»
  сходится.

- **Вставленное готовым телом `tls: {"enabled": false}` больше не уезжает в
  ядро ([§481](docs/spec/tasks/481-contract-1111-wg-awg-by-registry.md),
  контракт 1.1.12).** У ядра такая запись значит «TLS не задан», но явный
  выключенный блок ронял версии 1.14.0-lx.5…lx.18 при первом соединении.
  Ссылку и импорт конфигурации это правило защищало и раньше, а вот тело,
  написанное руками в редакторе JSON или пришедшее чужим бэкапом, доезжало
  как есть. Теперь выключенный блок — и вложенные `utls`/`reality`/`ech` со
  своим выключателем — снимается на общих правилах, молча и на любом входе.

- **Битый путь транспорта из Xray-подписки больше не уносит с собой весь VPN
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md), шаг 8).**
  Было: узел из Xray-конфига с испорченным percent-кодированием в пути
  WebSocket (`/x%zz`) уезжал в ядро как есть, а ядро отвергало на нём ВЕСЬ
  config.json — VPN не поднимался ни на одном узле, и понять, какой из них
  виноват, было неоткуда. У ссылки это правило работало давно, у Xray-входа
  судьи не было вовсе. Стало: путь снимается с узла, узел остаётся рабочим, а
  в уведомлениях названы поле и значение.

- **Узел из Xray-подписки с негодным `encryption` пропадает при разборе, а не
  стоит в списке рабочим
  ([§477](docs/spec/tasks/477-vless-encryption-grammar.md),
  [§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md) шаг 8).**
  Было: проверка формы у такого узла срабатывала, и в ядро он не уезжал, но в
  списке подписки стоял как обычный — человек выбирал его и не понимал, почему
  соединения нет. Стало: узел снимается там же, где узел из ссылки, — при
  разборе, с названной причиной. Если в том же элементе выжил сосед, причина
  показывается на нём.

- **Негодная строка `encryption` у VLESS отбраковывает один узел, а не роняет
  весь конфиг ([§477](docs/spec/tasks/477-vless-encryption-grammar.md),
  [#147](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/147), контракт 1.1.9).**
  Было: постквантовый слой у VLESS — закрытая грамматика ядра, и строка, которой
  она не соответствует, роняла старт ЦЕЛИКОМ. Одна испорченная строка в одном
  узле подписки — и VPN не поднимался ни на одном узле, а приложение значение не
  проверяло вовсе. Стало: форма строки сверяется с правилом контракта (имя
  метода и ещё не меньше трёх непустых частей через точку), и узел с негодным
  значением отбраковывается — с названной причиной, исходным значением и
  указанием поля. Соседи по подписке живут, VPN поднимается. Проверяется только
  форма и никогда грамматика целиком: копия грамматики разошлась бы с ядром на
  первом же обновлении и начала бы отбраковывать рабочие узлы. Заодно
  `encryption` со значением `None` и `NONE` больше не выдаётся за «слоя нет»:
  ядро сравнивает своё `none` с учётом регистра, и такая строка для него
  настоящее значение, на котором конфиг и падал.

- **Версия SOCKS из тела узла больше не теряется
  ([§475](docs/spec/tasks/475-contract-118-socks-version-by-scheme.md)).**
  Было: тело с `"version": "4"`, вписанное во вкладке JSON или пришедшее
  sing-box-объектом, уезжало в ядро пятёркой — ветка разбора поле не читала
  вовсе, и узел молча подключался не тем протоколом. Стало: значение читается,
  хранится и эмитится как написано; версия вне набора снимается с названной
  причиной, и узел работает как SOCKS5 — то есть по дефолту ядра.

- **Настройки TLS и заголовки транспорта больше не пропадают при
  пересохранении узла через вкладку JSON
  ([§476](docs/spec/tasks/476-body-fields-roundtrip-guard.md)).**
  Было: приложение писало поле в тело узла, но обратно его не читало, и на
  первом же Save настройка исчезала — молча, без предупреждения. Так терялись:

  - `tls.engine` — какой реализацией TLS делать рукопожатие;
  - `tls.spoof` и `tls.spoof_method` — подменный домен ClientHello и способ
    порчи пакета;
  - `tls.handshake_timeout` — таймаут рукопожатия;
  - заголовки транспорта ws и httpupgrade, кроме `Host`: узел с
    `User-Agent` или `X-Forwarded-For` возвращался без них;
  - заголовки транспорта http — их не читали вовсе.

  Стало: читаются все. Найдено не по жалобе, а новым сторожевым тестом, который
  прогоняет по кругу «тело → модель → тело» каждое поле каждого протокола из
  реестра контракта и падает, если поле по дороге пропало. Тот же класс, что
  `tls.certificate` в #140 и пять потерь, найденных по ходу §472.

- **naive-узел на QUIC больше не возвращается к HTTP/2 после пересохранения
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md) шаг 6).**
  Было: узел из ссылки `naive+quic://` работал, но стоило сохранить его через
  вкладку JSON или перечитать из сохранённого тела — транспорт QUIC молча
  пропадал, и узел переставал соединяться. Приложение писало настройку в тело
  узла, но обратно её не читало. Стало: читает. То же самое чинится у SSH —
  список алгоритмов ключа сервера (`host_key_algorithms`) пропадал тем же
  способом и по той же причине.

- **AnyTLS-узел с нечисловым `min_idle_session` больше не исчезает без следа
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md) шаг 6).**
  Было: подписка присылала число простаивающих сессий строкой (`"3"` вместо
  `3` — обычное дело у агрегаторов) или мусором, и узел пропадал из списка
  целиком, молча: разбор падал на этом поле и отдавал «узла нет». Стало: поле
  читается в обеих формах, а негодное значение снимается с предупреждением —
  узел остаётся на месте и работает на умолчании ядра.

- **Узел с обфускацией без пароля больше не пропадает целиком
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md) шаг 5).**
  Было: hysteria2-ссылка с `obfs=`, но без `obfs-password=`, роняла ВЕСЬ узел —
  вместе с рабочим сервером, до которого обфускация не имеет отношения. Тот же
  разбор снимал и узел с REALITY без ключа, хотя такому положено деградировать
  до обычного TLS. Причина: требование обязательного поля ВНУТРИ вложенного
  блока читалось так, будто поле обязательно у всей записи. Стало: снимается
  сам блок, узел живёт и получает предупреждение с названием поля — ровно то,
  что говорит контракт и чего ждёт корпус. Проявлялось на разборе тела узла из
  JSON; ссылку до этого шага разбирал отдельный код, который такой узел
  сохранял.

- **Постквантовый `encryption` у vless больше не теряется при импорте
  sing-box-объекта ([§335](docs/PROTOCOLS.md),
  [§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md) шаг 3).**
  Было: поле читалось только из ссылки и из Xray-JSON; узел, вставленный
  sing-box-объектом или отредактированный во вкладке JSON, уезжал в ядро без
  постквантового слоя и не поднимался. Стало: читается на всех входах.

- **Настройки TCP keep-alive узла (§453) не пропадают при разборе ссылки
  trojan и shadowsocks.** Шаг 2 отдавал их санитайзеру контракта, который
  таких полей не знает (лаунчер их не пишет) и снимал их вместе с предупреждением
  «неизвестный ключ» о настройке самого приложения. Теперь они идут мимо
  санитайзера — у trojan, vless и shadowsocks одинаково. Проявлялось только
  в приложении: в тестах реестр не был загружен, и санитайзер там не работал.

- **Плагин shadowsocks (SIP003) больше не теряется при импорте
  sing-box-объекта
  ([§472](docs/spec/tasks/472F-unified-parse-pipeline/spec.md) шаг 4).**
  Было: `plugin` и `plugin_opts` читались только из ссылки; узел, вставленный
  sing-box-объектом или отредактированный во вкладке JSON, уезжал в ядро без
  плагина и соединения не поднимал, хотя в конфиг эти поля пишутся. Стало:
  читаются на всех входах. Тот же класс, что постквантовый `encryption` у
  vless шагом раньше.

- **`short_id` REALITY, написанный заглавными, больше не вызывает
  предупреждение.** `sid=ABCD` приводится к `abcd` молча: регистр ничего не
  теряет. Сообщение остаётся там, где значение действительно испорчено
  (`0x1a2`, пробел внутри). Раньше расхождение с контрактом было незаметным —
  правило срабатывало только на JSON-входе.

- **Негодный ключ REALITY объясняется одним сообщением, а не тремя.** Узел с
  мусорным `pbk` деградирует до обычного TLS; `short_id` и `key_share`
  уходят вместе с блоком и своих сообщений «поле требует public_key» больше
  не дают.

- **Предупреждение о снятом неизвестном ключе называет снятое значение
  ([§470](docs/spec/tasks/470-corpus-body-runner-warnings.md)).**
  Было: ключ, которого у протокола нет, снимался с пометкой «поле снято:
  неизвестный ключ» и путём — но без значения. Из-за одного такого ключа ядро
  отказывается запускать весь конфиг, поэтому снимать его приходится, а по
  одному пути человек не мог понять, что именно он потерял и стоит ли за этим
  опечатка.
  Стало: пометка несёт и значение — так же, как у остальных снятых полей и как
  на второй стороне контракта.

- **Отпечаток uTLS и REALITY на QUIC-узле больше не пропадают молча
  ([§469](docs/spec/tasks/469-contract-114-quic-tls-not-applicable.md),
  контракт 1.1.4).**
  Было: ядро не умеет ни отпечаток uTLS, ни REALITY поверх QUIC (hysteria2,
  tuic, masque, hysteria) — оно строит их TLS стандартным движком, и с таким
  блоком узел не поднялся бы вовсе. Мы блоки срезали, но ничего об этом не
  говорили: подписка выдала `fp=chrome` на hysteria2-узле, параметр не
  действовал, и пользователь об этом не узнавал. `fp` на tuic не читался
  вовсе.
  Стало: узел получает пометку «к сведению» — какое поле снято и почему, с
  причиной и советом в карточке. Один код на блок: снятый REALITY считается
  целиком, `short_id` и `key_share` своих пометок не дают. Тело узла от этого
  не изменилось — блок и раньше не доезжал до конфига, так что ни один
  работающий узел не затронут.
  Какие протоколы и какой код — теперь правило реестра контракта
  (`forbidden_for` + новый `forbidden_codes`), а не список протоколов в коде.
  Заодно в список попала hysteria v1, которой в прозе контракта не было,
  хотя ядро ходит к ней тем же путём.

- **Обфускация hysteria2 из JSON-тела: снятое значение объявляется
  ([§469](docs/spec/tasks/469-contract-114-quic-tls-not-applicable.md) п. 6).**
  Было: узел, пришедший ссылкой, получал `obfs_unknown` /
  `obfs_password_missing`, а тот же узел, пришедший телом sing-box, — ничего.
  Тип вне словаря ядра и обфускация без пароля снимались молча.
  Стало: коды на обоих входах. Тело узла прежнее.

- **Рабочая секция `xmux` у узлов vless + xhttp больше не портится
  ([§467](docs/spec/tasks/467-contract-111-sync.md), контракт 1.1.1).**
  Было: подписка присылает секцию в полной форме, где незаданные поля выписаны
  нулями (`max_concurrency: "16-32"` при `max_connections: "0"`). Санитайзер
  проверял наличие ключа, читал это как конфликт, снимал рабочее значение и
  возвращал дефолт `"1-1"` — пропускная способность узла падала молча. Тот же
  дефект у лаунчера задел 13 живых узлов.
  Стало: `conflicts` и `requires` судят ЗНАЧЕНИЕ, как это делает ядро. Не
  задано — отсутствие ключа, `null`, `""`, `0`, `false`, пустой объект, пустой
  массив и строка-число из одних нулей (`"0"`, `"0-0"`). Правило общее и так же
  судит `certificate` ↔ `pins` и `reality` ↔ `ech`.
  Заодно `all_or_nothing` перестал дописывать дефолты соседей в частично
  заданный объект: ядро оставляет незаданные поля нулями, то есть без лимита, а
  дописывание навязывало узлу лимиты, которых у него не было.

### Changed

- **«Copy URI» у узла с приватным ключом в ссылке — предупреждение вместо
  отказа ([§466](docs/spec/tasks/466-copy-link-private-key-confirm.md)).**
  Было: у SSH-узла с inline-ключом копирование отклонялось снэкбаром, а
  WireGuard уносил ключ интерфейса в буфер молча. Перенести свой узел на своё
  второе устройство ссылкой было нельзя.
  Стало: одно поведение для всех узлов, чья ссылка несёт приватный ключ (SSH с
  `private_key`, WireGuard и AWG, MASQUE) — диалог «Link contains a private
  key» с кнопками Cancel / Copy anyway. По Cancel и по тапу мимо буфер не
  трогается. Сама ссылка (`toUri()`) не изменилась: это форма хранения узла,
  ключ в ней обязан остаться.

- **Контракт синхронизирован с волной W2d лаунчера
  ([§464](docs/spec/tasks/464-contract-w2d-sync.md)).**
  Лаунчер вынес правила значений из URI-парсеров в санитайзер по реестру, а в
  реестр добавил выражения, которых там не было. Санитайзер LxBox понимает их
  все: `format: base64_32` (ключ ровно 32 байта после декода), `normalize:
  hex_only` с `normalize_code`, `normalize: grpc_service_name`, `advisory` с
  `except`/`when`, `requires` с `equals`, `default_when`, типы полей
  `awg_range` и `int_array`. Выражение, которое реестр заведёт следующим, в
  лог уходит один раз и значение не трогает: контракт вправе ехать впереди
  клиента.
  Порядок `warnings[]` в конверте стал `body.order` реестра, а не порядок
  разбора — коды сравнимы поэлементно.
  Корпус снят с коммита лаунчера `be8079bf`.

- **Hysteria2: полоса читается в обоих написаниях
  ([§464](docs/spec/tasks/464-contract-w2d-sync.md)).**
  Было: ссылка с `up_mbps=100&down_mbps=200` теряла полосу молча — разбор знал
  только `upmbps`/`downmbps`.
  Стало: оба написания читаются (реестр объявил их алиасами), эмиссия
  по-прежнему пишет канонические `upmbps`/`downmbps`.

- **gRPC: имя сервиса в Xray-форме `/<сервис>/Tun`
  ([§464](docs/spec/tasks/464-contract-w2d-sync.md), issue #130).**
  Было: `serviceName=/abcde/Tun` уезжал в конфиг целиком, и на проводе
  получалось `/%2Fabcde%2FTun/Tun` — узел не работал.
  Стало: ведущий `/` и хвост `/Tun` снимаются (`/abcde/Tun` → `abcde`), путь
  на проводе сохраняется. Правило одно на ссылку, Xray-JSON и санитайзер.

- **Ядро `v1.14.1-lx.4` → `v1.14.1-lx.7`
  ([§461](docs/spec/tasks/461-kernel-lx5-short-id-hotfix.md),
  [§462](docs/spec/tasks/462-kernel-lx7-validation-error-tags.md)).**
  Три слоя изменений.
  SPEC 090 (lx.5): REALITY `short_id` длиннее 16 hex-символов теперь отвергается
  с ошибкой `invalid short_id` до декодирования — и на клиенте, и на сервере.
  Раньше такой узел ронял процесс паникой `index out of range`: ядро писало
  результат `hex.Decode` в массив `[8]byte`, не проверив длину входа. Гард §343
  на стороне приложения остаётся: слишком длинный `short_id` по-прежнему
  отбрасывается при разборе.
  SPEC 091 (lx.6): ядро проверяет `tuic.udp_relay_mode` — мусор вместо
  `native`/`quic` даёт `unknown udp_relay_mode: X (expected native or quic)`,
  раньше принималась любая строка; заодно проверяется masque `uri`
  (единственное значение — `standard`). Гард §459 в форме узла остаётся: он
  ловит ошибку до старта ядра.
  SPEC 092 (lx.7): в ошибках инициализации ядро называет тип и тег записи —
  `initialize outbound[0] vless[proxy-de-1]: invalid short_id` вместо голого
  индекса; шесть мест (DNS server, endpoint, inbound, service, outbound,
  certificate provider). По заявке пользователя от 18.09: приложение показывает
  текст ядра как есть, а индекс во внутреннем массиве конфига ничего не говорит.
  Провод, схема конфига, наборы тегов AAR, Go-тулчейн и сабмодули без изменений;
  Java-поверхность совпадает с lx.4 (javap по всем 253 классам — дифф пуст).

- **Ядро `v1.14.1-lx.7` → `v1.14.1-lx.8`: имя gRPC-сервиса уходит ядру как есть
  ([§468](docs/spec/tasks/468-kernel-lx8-grpc-service-name-verbatim.md),
  контракт 1.1.3).**
  Было: `serviceName` с ведущим «/» (Xray-форма готового пути) приложение
  переводило в имя сервиса — `/abcde/Tun` становилось `abcde` (§464). Перевод
  чинил только односегментную запись: `/a/b/Tun` он превращал в `a/b`, и ядро
  всё равно уезжало на провод с `%2F` внутри, а нестандартное имя потока вроде
  `/a/Stream` ломалось.
  Стало: SPEC 093 ядра разбирает ведущий «/» сам — сегменты экранируются по
  отдельности, последний называет поток, хвост `|…` отбрасывается, и
  `/a/b/Tun` уезжает на провод ровно таким. Нормализация снята целиком: на
  URI- и на JSON-пути значение хранится и эмитится байт в байт как пришло, на
  узле предупреждений не появляется.
  Правило нормативно для пина lx.8 и новее: откат ядра ниже означает вернуть
  перевод односегментной формы.
  Провод в остальном, схема конфига, наборы тегов AAR, Go-тулчейн и сабмодули
  без изменений; Java-поверхность совпадает с lx.7 (javap по всем 253 классам —
  дифф пуст).

- **Предупреждение об отпечатке REALITY понижено до «к сведению» (контракт
  1.1.2, [§468](docs/spec/tasks/468-kernel-lx8-grpc-service-name-verbatim.md)).**
  Было: код `reality_fp_not_chrome` показывался как ⚠ наравне с полями, которые
  приложение у узла сняло или переписало.
  Стало: уровень `info`. Код не говорит, что с узлом что-то сделали — отпечаток
  уходит в конфиг ровно таким, каким его дала подписка; он предупреждает о
  ВОЗМОЖНОМ отказе сервера, и у живого узла это сведения, а не проблема.
  Уровень теперь читается из реестра контракта, а не из константы в коде.

### Fixed

- **naive: ссылка вида `naive+https://пароль@хост` не авторизовалась
  ([§465](docs/spec/tasks/465-naive-single-userinfo-password.md)).**
  Было: одиночный userinfo (без двоеточия) читался как имя пользователя с
  пустым паролем, а собственный эмиттер писал пароль ровно в этот слот —
  ссылка, которую приложение отдало само, читалась им же наоборот. По той же
  конвенции пишут пароль NekoBox, NaiveGUI и Go-сторона, так что узел из
  чужой подписки уходил на сервер без пароля.
  Стало: `пароль@хост` — это пароль, `имя:@хост` — имя без пароля,
  `имя:пароль@хост` — как раньше. Узел «только имя» теперь и эмитится с
  двоеточием (`имя:@`). Хранение узла — текст ссылки, поэтому миграция не
  нужна: сохранённый `пароль@хост` после обновления прочитается правильно.
  Обратный вырожденный случай — узел, которому пользователь руками задал
  только имя без пароля, сохранённый прежней версией как `имя@`, — после
  обновления прочитается паролем; naive без пароля всё равно не
  авторизуется, задать имя заново достаточно один раз.

- **Мусорный REALITY-ключ снимался молча на одном из входов
  ([§464](docs/spec/tasks/464-contract-w2d-sync.md)).**
  Было: `pbk=enabled` или `pbk=true` из битой подписки снимали REALITY, узел
  деградировал до plain TLS — но по ссылке это происходило без единого слова
  (только отладочный лог), тогда как импорт JSON ставил код. Один и тот же
  узел, пришедший двумя путями, нёс разные наборы кодов.
  Стало: `reality_pbk_invalid` ставится на всех путях. Длина ключа считается
  после декода: `enabled` и `true` — валидный base64 на 5 и 3 байта, и
  проверка «декодируется ли» их пропускала.

- **Размеры пакетов gecko молча исчезали на salamander
  ([§464](docs/spec/tasks/464-contract-w2d-sync.md)).**
  Было: `obfs=salamander` вместе с `obfs-min-packet-size` — эмиттер поле не
  писал и ничего не говорил; тот же узел, пришедший телом, санитайзер чистил с
  кодом.
  Стало: поле снимается с `field_requires` на обоих входах.

- **VMess с методом шифрования вне словаря ядра ронял весь конфиг ([§459](docs/spec/tasks/459-guards-contract-24-2.md)).**
  Было: разбор пропускал `aes-128-ctr`, которого ядро не знает — один такой
  узел подписки не давал подняться VPN целиком; рабочий `aes-128-cfb`
  наоборот схлопывался в `auto`, и узел молча менял шифр. Стало: `security`
  сверяется с набором ядра (`auto`, `none`, `zero`, `aes-128-cfb`,
  `aes-128-gcm`, `chacha20-poly1305`), `chacha20-ietf-poly1305` — алиас,
  иное значение подменяется на `auto`. Одна воронка на все три входа: ссылка
  v2rayN, sing-box JSON и Xray JSON (раньше JSON-ветки брали значение как
  есть).

- **Мусор в XHTTP `mode` ронял весь конфиг ([§459](docs/spec/tasks/459-guards-contract-24-2.md)).**
  Было: `mode` уходил в конфиг как есть, а ядро на неизвестном значении
  отказывает всему файлу. Стало: значение сверяется с набором ядра (`auto`,
  `packet-up`, `stream-up`, `stream-one`) в эмите — единственной воронке для
  ссылок, обоих JSON-диалектов и редактора; не подошедшее снимается с
  предупреждением, как уже было у `seq_placement`. Регистр не нормализуется:
  ядро различает его, `queryInHeader` в `x_padding_placement` — только
  camelCase.

- **`tls.ech` из JSON терялся на сохранении ([§459](docs/spec/tasks/459-guards-contract-24-2.md)).**
  Было: блок вырезался разбором — §454 исключил его из allowlist'а, считая,
  что ядро собрано без ECH. Посылка неверна: ECH компилируется всегда, и
  конфиг с `tls.ech` ядро принимает. Стало: объект проходит в той форме, в
  какой приехал, и эмитится на месте структуры ядра; naive его тоже
  принимает. Параметр `ech=` в ссылке Xray-формы по-прежнему снимается с
  предупреждением — он несёт имя чужого публичного пробника, а не ключ
  сервера.

- **`key_share` с другим регистром терялся молча ([§459](docs/spec/tasks/459-guards-contract-24-2.md)).**
  Было: `Hybrid` из подписки не совпадал со строгим `hybrid` — поле
  исчезало, REALITY поднимался с другим обменом ключами. Стало: значение
  приводится к нижнему регистру и обрезается по краям, затем сверяется со
  словарём; мусор по-прежнему снимается. Обе точки — ссылка и JSON.

- **Узел с `flow=xtls-rprx-vision-udp443` становился недозваниваемым ([§459](docs/spec/tasks/459-guards-contract-24-2.md)).**
  Было: разбор Xray JSON переписывал порт узла на 443 — узел `…:8443` уезжал
  в конфиг с чужим портом. Стало: суффикс по-прежнему разворачивается в
  `xtls-rprx-vision` + `packet_encoding: xudp`, но порт остаётся тем, что дал
  источник. Порт — свойство узла, а не флага.

- **Узел Xray с транспортом `splithttp` уезжал в конфиг вообще без транспорта ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: `splithttp` — прежнее имя `xhttp` в Xray — не опознавался ни в
  ссылке, ни в обоих JSON-диалектах, и узел собирался голым TCP на порт,
  который ждёт HTTP: мёртв без единого сообщения. Стало: имя принимается как
  алиас `xhttp`, в Xray-JSON рядом с `xhttpSettings` читается и
  `splithttpSettings`.

- **Битое percent-кодирование в пути транспорта роняло весь конфиг ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: путь вида `/x%zz` доезжал до тела как есть — разбор на нём не падает.
  Ядро же читает путь через `url.Parse` и на битом escape отказывает всему
  `config.json` (`ws: parse path: invalid URL escape`; то же у `httpupgrade`
  и `http`). Стало: поле снимается с кодом `type_invalid`, узел живёт.

- **Одинокий `jmin` у AmneziaWG роняло весь конфиг ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: битый `jc` снимался молча, а `jmin=50` оставался; отсутствующий
  `jmax` ядро читает как 0 и отказывает всему конфигу
  (`jmin (50) must be <= jmax (0)`). Стало: `jmin` без `jmax` снимается с
  кодом `awg_header_invalid`, узел остаётся AmneziaWG (кламп MTU 1280
  сохраняется — его просила ссылка, а не уцелевшие поля).

- **Узел naive с пустым адресом сервера роняло весь конфиг ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: `naive+https://` оставался живым узлом с `server: ""`. Ядро на пустом
  адресе валит весь конфиг (`invalid server address`), то есть один такой
  узел подписки оставлял человека вообще без VPN. Стало: узел
  отбраковывается.

- **Мусор в TUIC `udp_relay_mode` молча подменялся на `native` ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: любое непонятное значение схлопывалось в `native` и уезжало в тело
  явным полем — намерение подписки терялось, а узел выглядел настроенным.
  Стало: поле снимается с кодом `tuic_udp_relay_mode_invalid`, ядро
  подставляет свой дефолт само.

- **Пароль socks-прокси без имени пользователя пропадал ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: пустой `username` снимал userinfo ссылки целиком, и пароль терялся на
  первом же пересохранении узла — ссылка и есть форма хранения. Стало:
  эмитится `:pass@`, как уже было у http-прокси.

- **Мусорный SNI у AnyTLS давал мёртвый узел без объяснения ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: значение вроде `🔒` уезжало в `tls.server_name` как есть —
  `sing-box check` такой конфиг проходит, а рукопожатие мертво: сервер
  получает имя, которого не знает. Стало: имя без точки и двоеточия
  заменяется адресом сервера.

### Changed

- **Отпечаток `hellorandom*` больше не подменяется на `chrome` ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: Xray-имена `hellorandomized*` приводились к `randomized`, а голый
  `hellorandom` не опознавался вовсе и уезжал в `chrome`. Подписка просила
  случайный ClientHello, а получала фиксированный — ровно ту узнаваемую
  сигнатуру, от которой уходила. Стало: весь префикс даёт `random`.

- **Устаревшие stream-шифры Shadowsocks больше не выбрасывают узел ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: девять шифров (`aes-*-ctr`, `aes-*-cfb`, `rc4-md5`, `chacha20-ietf`,
  `xchacha20`) отсутствовали в словаре, и рабочие узлы молча пропадали из
  подписки. Стало: набор равен 18 методам ядра, такой узел живёт и несёт
  info-предупреждение `ss_method_legacy` — шифр без AEAD, трафик шифруется,
  но не аутентифицируется, и человек об этом узнаёт.

- **Ссылка на SSH-узел с приватным ключом больше не копируется ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Было: «Copy link» клал в буфер ссылку с `private_key` в query — ключ уезжал
  вместе с любой пересылкой. Стало: действие отказывает и объясняет причину.
  Из `toUri()` ключ не вырезается: тот же текст — форма хранения узла, и
  вырезание потеряло бы ключ при перезагрузке.

- **Пустой `reality.short_id` больше не пишется в тело ([§463](docs/spec/tasks/463-contract-w2c-corpus-conformance.md)).**
  Ядру пустая строка эквивалентна отсутствующему ключу, а корпус контракта
  нормирует именно опущенный. Поведение узла не меняется.

### Added

- **Реестр контракта в приложении: схема тела узла и тексты предупреждений едут в APK ([§460](docs/spec/tasks/460F-contract-registry-bundle/spec.md), волна W1).**
  Контракт 1.1.0 вынес схему тела 384 полей из структур ядра `1.14.1-lx.4` в
  реестр. Раньше правила «какое поле у какого протокола допустимо и что делать
  с мусором» были написаны руками по протоколу и расходились с ядром на каждом
  пине. Теперь реестр бандлится в `assets/contract/`, а сборка конфига чистит
  по нему каждую запись `outbounds`/`endpoints`: неизвестный ключ, значение вне
  enum'а, поле, запрещённое протоколу (TLS у naive), поле новее запущенного
  ядра или чужой платформы — снимаются до того, как конфиг уйдёт в ядро, где
  любое из них роняет конфиг целиком. Тексты предупреждений берутся из реестра
  на языке интерфейса и несут путь поля. Валидный конфиг не меняется.

## [2.24.4] — 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **Вкладка JSON у DNS-сервера из шаблона или пресета показывала ошибку вместо содержимого ([#143](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/143), [§458](docs/spec/tasks/458-dns-server-json-tab-storage-record.md)).**
  Регрессия v2.24.0: после перехода на записи хранения 1.0 у модели
  DNS-сервера не осталось прямой сериализации, а вкладка по-прежнему
  кодировала её напрямую. Теперь блок «storage shape» строится кодеком записи.
  Пользовательские (inline) серверы затронуты не были.

## [2.24.3] — 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **Узел Tailscale терял тело при переезде в папку ([§456](docs/spec/tasks/456-wg-ini-as-source-tag-in-record.md)).**
  `TailscaleSpec` единственный из типов не хранил свой источник, и при
  добавлении в папку член оставался с пустым телом. Теперь узел несёт объект
  outbound'а, как все остальные типы из JSON.

- **JSON-редактор узла терял `tls.certificate` и соседние TLS-поля ([#140](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/140), [§454](docs/spec/tasks/454-tls-certificate-round-trip.md)).**
  Было: модель TLS знала шесть полей, остальное разбор отбрасывал молча для
  всех протоколов; у naive поверх этого оставались только `enabled` и
  `server_name`. Свой корневой CA в `certificate` пропадал на Save, узел на
  самоподписанном сертификате не поднимался, а `insecure` naive отвергает.
  Стало: модель несёт все TLS-поля ядра (`OutboundTLSOptions`) — сквозные
  ключи хранятся и эмитятся в той форме, в какой приехали (строка остаётся
  строкой, массив массивом); naive пропускает `certificate` и
  `certificate_path`, всё, что ядро на нём отвергает, по-прежнему режется;
  пин `certificate_public_key_sha256` теперь читается и из JSON. Значение не
  того типа отбрасывается полем, не узлом. Узлы без новых полей эмитятся
  байт в байт прежними. Норма allowlist'а общая с лаунчером (контракт
  TASKS_LXBOX §22).
- **Узел из JSON терял поля при переезде в папку и в «Copy link» (§454).**
  Узел из sing-box JSON не хранил свой источник (у Xray — заглушка) и в этих
  местах пересобирался через share-URI, где нет ни сертификата, ни других
  JSON-only полей. Теперь узел из JSON несёт свой объект outbound'а как
  источник (`rawSource`; прежнее `rawUri` переименовано, второе поле
  `sourceCompact` слито в него) и предъявляет его как есть.

### Changed

- **Ядро `v1.14.1-lx.3` → `v1.14.1-lx.4` ([§457](docs/spec/tasks/457-kernel-lx4-reality-key-share.md)).**
  Два изменения по REALITY. `tls.fragment` и `tls.record_fragment` теперь
  действуют и на REALITY-узлы (ядро SPEC 088): раньше REALITY-клиент строил
  рукопожатие на голом сокете и оба молча пропускал, включая авто-
  `record_fragment`, который ядро включает под `detour` — глобальный тумблер
  фрагментации выглядел включённым и на этих узлах ничего не делал. Со стороны
  приложения не изменилось ничего: пост-шаг `applyTlsFragment` REALITY-узлы
  никогда не исключал, тумблер просто начал на них работать. Второе — по-узловая
  опция `tls.reality.key_share` (ядро SPEC 089), см. ниже. Провод, наборы тегов
  AAR и Go-тулчейн без изменений; Java-поверхность совпадает с lx.3 (javap по
  всем 253 классам — дифф пуст).

- **WireGuard из `.conf` хранится как файл, тег — отдельно ([§456](docs/spec/tasks/456-wg-ini-as-source-tag-in-record.md)).**
  Было: INI переводился в синтетическую ссылку `wg://…#имя`, и источником узла
  хранилась она — комментарии и порядок строк файла терялись, вид записи был
  `uri`. Стало: источник — сам текст INI байт в байт, вид записи `wg_ini` (как
  у лаунчера), тег — поле записи и применяется при чтении. Начальное имя:
  комментарий сразу под `[Peer]` (Proton пишет туда `# CH-FREE#11`), иначе имя
  файла при импорте, иначе `WireGuard`. `vpn://` (Amnezia) даёт каждому узлу
  контейнера свой INI. Старые записи со ссылкой читаются как раньше.

### Added

- **REALITY: выбор key share узла — `hybrid` или `classical` ([§457](docs/spec/tasks/457-kernel-lx4-reality-key-share.md)).**
  `hybrid` требует `X25519MLKEM768`: ClientHello вырастает до ~1,5–1,9 КБ и
  уезжает двумя TCP-сегментами — этого требуют Xray-серверы от v26.9.8.
  `classical` вырезает гибрид из `key_share` и `supported_groups`: ~0,5 КБ и
  один сегмент — для серверов постарше и для сетей, которые большое
  рукопожатие роняют. Без поля — как несёт отпечаток, прежнее поведение.
  Задаётся по узлу: `tls.reality.key_share` в sing-box JSON и `key_share=` в
  share-ссылке (vless, anytls). Значение вне пары отбрасывается молча, узел
  остаётся жив: ядро на неизвестном значении отвергает не узел, а весь конфиг.
  Требует ядра `v1.14.1-lx.4`.

- **Редактор узла: вкладки Source и JSON; JSON-источник уходит в ядро как есть ([§455](docs/spec/tasks/455-node-editor-source-json-tabs.md)).**
  Было: вкладка JSON показывала не источник, а пересборку модели, и Save
  затирал источник этой копией. Стало: *Source* — исходный текст узла как
  хранится (ссылка, WireGuard-конфиг или sing-box JSON), единственное место
  правки; *JSON* — только чтение, то, что получит ядро. Узел, чей источник —
  JSON-объект, идёт в конфиг дословно, включая поля, которых приложение не
  знает; проверяет его ядро при сохранении (`Libbox.checkConfig`), отвергнутое
  тело не сохраняется, ошибка ядра показывается словами ядра. Кнопка «Edit
  JSON» после предупреждения заменяет источник показанным JSON и уводит в
  Source; обратно в ссылку узел не превращается. Правило то же, что у
  лаунчера для ручного объекта. Хранение не менялось: вид источника выводится
  из текста, флага нет.
- **TCP keep-alive на узле ([§453](docs/spec/tasks/453-tcp-keep-alive-dial-fields.md)).**
  Было: поля `disable_tcp_keep_alive`, `tcp_keep_alive` и
  `tcp_keep_alive_interval` ядро принимает с 1.13, но приложение их не знало:
  вписанные во вкладку «Outbound JSON» они пропадали на Save — разбор
  собирал узел из фиксированного набора ключей, а незнакомые выбрасывал
  молча. Стало: поля стали частью узла и ходят во всех трёх формах, которыми
  узел хранится и передаётся, — sing-box JSON, share-URI и Xray JSON (там
  keep-alive лежит в `sockopt` целыми секундами; отрицательное значение
  означает выключенный keep-alive). Носителей девять — протоколы с TCP-дозвоном;
  QUIC/UDP-узлам поля не к чему применить, и они их не принимают. Значение не
  в формате Go-duration отбрасывается на входе: ядро отвергает такое поле
  фаталом на весь конфиг. Узлы без этих полей эмитятся прежними
  байт-в-байт. Полей в форме узла нет — путь через JSON-вкладку и импорт.

## [2.24.2] — 2026-09-16

### Added

- **Упрощённый китайский — третий язык интерфейса ([§452](docs/spec/tasks/452-zh-localization.md)).**
  Было: интерфейс существовал на английском и русском; пользователи из
  материкового Китая просили китайский ([#139](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/139)).
  Стало: переведён весь интерфейс — настройки, мастер узла, маршрутизация и
  DNS, а также нативные поверхности Android (уведомление, плитка быстрых
  настроек, ярлыки). Язык выбирается в «Общие → Язык → 中文（简体）»; при
  значении «Системный» приложение следует языку устройства. Перевод прислал
  [@wyphgsy](https://github.com/wyphgsy) в [#137](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/pull/137);
  словарь доведён до текущей ветки — 58 строк, появившихся в 2.24.x (узлы
  Tailscale, секции узлов), переведены, две устаревшие удалены.

### Fixed

- **Проверки локализации охватывают все языки, а не только русский ([§452](docs/spec/tasks/452-zh-localization.md)).**
  Было: `ui_check` был зашит на `assets/l10n/ru/ui.json`, `kotlin_check` — на
  `values-ru/strings.xml`. На заведомо неполном китайском словаре оба
  показывали «0 находок»: они его не видели. Язык, добавленный ровно по
  документации, оставался вне CI и тихо отставал бы с каждой новой строкой.
  Стало: оба чекера находят языки по каталогам — так уже делал
  `template_check`, — а набор plural-форм берётся для каждого языка отдельно
  и зеркалит выбор resolver'а в `LocaleController`. Новый язык попадает под
  гейты самим фактом своих файлов, править чекеры под него не нужно.

## [2.24.1] — 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **Ядро обновлено до 1.14.1-lx.3; отпечатки Firefox и Safari снова работают с REALITY ([§451](docs/spec/tasks/451-reality-fp-firefox-safari-hybrid.md)).**
  Было: серверы Xray начиная с версии 26.9.8 принимают только приветствие с
  постквантовым ключом обмена, а библиотека отпечатков несла его лишь в профилях
  Chrome — узлы с отпечатком `firefox` и `safari` молча уходили на камуфляжный
  сайт, и приложение советовало сменить отпечаток на `chrome`. Стало: ядро
  принесло профили Firefox 148 и Safari 26.3 с нужным ключом, оба отпечатка
  проходят и на новых, и на старых серверах, предупреждение для них снято.
  Отпечатки `edge`, `ios`, `android`, `360` и `qq` такого ключа по-прежнему не
  несут — предупреждение на них остаётся. Отпечаток из подписки, как и раньше,
  не подменяется. Заодно рукопожатие VLESS с шифрованием больше не виснет
  бесконечно на узле, который принимает соединение и молчит.
- **Узел Tailscale: имя устройства в tailnet по умолчанию ([§449](docs/spec/tasks/449-tailscale-default-hostname.md)).**
  Было: поле Hostname в мастере открывалось пустым, и имя выбирал сам
  Tailscale — брал имя хоста системы, отчего устройство появлялось в админке
  как `node`, а при нескольких узлах — `node-1`, `node-2`. Стало: поле
  заполнено значением `LxBox-<модель устройства>`; его можно править или
  стереть — пустое поле по-прежнему отдаёт выбор имени Tailscale. Имя уже
  вошедшего в tailnet устройства так не меняется: оно задаётся при первом
  входе.

### Fixed

- **Ссылка `awg://` с конфигом внутри больше не теряет узел ([§450](docs/spec/tasks/450-awg-conf-base64-link.md)).**
  Было: панели раздают AmneziaWG 3.1 ссылкой, в которой после `awg://` лежит
  base64 целого файла `.conf`, а не привычное `ключ@хост:порт`; разбор искал в
  тексте хост, не находил приватный ключ и молча выбрасывал узел — источник
  оставался пустым. Стало: такая ссылка распознаётся по форме и разбирается тем
  же путём, что вставленный файл `.conf` — с полями AmneziaWG 2 и 3, ограничением
  MTU и проверкой ключей. Имя узла берётся из части после `#`, а без неё — из
  адреса сервера.
- **Workspaces: загрузка слота пересобирает конфиг ([§447](docs/spec/tasks/447-v2-24-0-avd-findings.md)).**
  Было: после переключения слота VPN стартовал с конфигом прежнего слота —
  признак «конфиг устарел» держался только на времени изменения файлов и гас
  при первой же записи настроек (так было и в 2.23.2). Стало: загрузка слота
  помечает конфиг устаревшим явно, главный экран пересобирает его из настроек
  нового слота до старта VPN.
- **Редактор правила: Save в верхней панели проверяет JSON ([§447](docs/spec/tasks/447-v2-24-0-avd-findings.md)).**
  Было: кнопка Save в верхней панели и Save из диалога несохранённых правок
  сохраняли массив (правило делилось на «Rule 2» и «Rule 2 #2») и невалидный
  JSON (правило без тела, набранный текст терялся). Стало: обе кнопки
  заблокированы той же проверкой, что кнопка формы, текст остаётся в поле;
  сообщение об ошибке переносится на строки, а не обрезается.
- **Routing: у JSON-правила в списке нет выпадающего списка outbound ([§447](docs/spec/tasks/447-v2-24-0-avd-findings.md)).**
  Было: тайл показывал `direct` даже для тела с `action: reject`, выбор ничего
  не менял. Стало: действие видно в подписи с телом правила, как в редакторе.
- **Восстановление бэкапа с заменой не возвращает стартовые вопросы ([§447](docs/spec/tasks/447-v2-24-0-avd-findings.md)).**
  Было: после Replace и перезапуска заново всплывали «Add tile» и «Check for
  updates?». Стало: отметки «уже спрашивали» остаются на устройстве, как ключи
  Debug API.

- **Tailscale: каталог состояния держится за узлом ([§445](docs/spec/tasks/445-tailscale-state-dir-lifecycle.md)).**
  Было: каталог `tailscale/<финальный тег>` менял имя при переименовании узла
  или смене префикса папки — узел входил в tailnet новым устройством, а
  одноразовый ключ уже потрачен; удалённый узел оставлял ключи на диске; слоты
  Workspaces делили один набор каталогов. Стало: имя каталога выдаётся узлу один
  раз (индекс `tailscale_state.json`) и не меняется при переименовании и
  переносе; удаление узла, папки или подписки удаляет каталог при остановленном
  VPN, осиротевшие каталоги снимает сборка; у каждого слота Workspaces свой
  набор, Delete слота удаляет его каталоги; каталоги 2.24.0 подхватываются без
  переименования.

---

## [2.24.0] — 2026-09-15

### Added

- **LX Backup формата 1.0: запись и чтение ([§438](docs/spec/tasks/438-lx-backup-1-0-read-write.md), [§439](docs/spec/tasks/439F-storage-contract-1-0/spec.md)).**
  Было: перенос в десктопный лаунчер писал формат 0.12, а файл лаунчера
  формата 1.0 (`lx_backup: 2`) отвергался как «новее поддерживаемого». Стало:
  экспорт пишет только 1.0, импорт читает 1.0 и старые файлы 0.12 одним
  слиянием. Запись файла — та же запись, что лежит в хранении телефона
  (см. Changed): экспорт берёт её тем же кодеком и по одной таблице срезает
  только рантайм (статусы подписки, кэш узлов). Формат общий с десктопным
  лаунчером [1.6.0](https://github.com/Leadaxe/singbox-launcher/releases/tag/v1.6.0)
  (контракт 1.0.3); лаунчер 1.6.0 пишет только 1.0, и 2.23.2 его файл не
  импортирует.

  | Данные | 0.12 | 1.0 (2.24.0) |
  |---|---|---|
  | папка | члены отдельными записями серверов, настройки папки и нечитаемые члены терялись | запись `folder` со своим составом, нечитаемый член — `unsupported` с исходным текстом |
  | узел автовыбора в папке | из файла 1.0 не ввозился (`backup_source_kind_unsupported`) | запись `kind: auto` в обе стороны; `selector` из файла читается urltest'ом с `backup_group_degraded` |
  | секции узла, личный detour узла, общий detour подписки и папки | не ехали | едут; ссылки на узлы — `{folder_id, tag}` с сырым тегом члена, а не тег с префиксом |
  | правило вида json | терялось | запись с телом sing-box как есть; массив тел раскладывается на правила «имя», «имя #2»… на обоих входах (0.12 и 1.0) |
  | preset-сервер DNS | по тегу | по ссылке `<preset>:<tag>` |
  | DNS `default_domain_resolver` | не ехал | едет |
  | номера правил | — | номера файла сохраняются (D-116); файл без размеченных корневых правил номеров не даёт (разметка — при загрузке Routing), неразмеченные правила частично размеченного файла встают в хвост не ниже 1000 |
  | настройки LxBox: import-rules и реакция на обновление подписки, политика detour, префикс одиночного сервера, ping-опции папки, имя цепочки, TTL srs-правила, verbatim, описание и переменные DNS-сервера, правило и значки узла автовыбора | import-rules, политика detour и ping-опции папки не ехали (`backup_local_only_dropped`) | едут все: контракт 1.0.1 объявил их полями стороны LxBox; лаунчер их молча игнорирует, импорт LxBox применяет, а поле, которого в файле нет, значение на телефоне не сбрасывает |

  Не едут и называются при экспорте только srs-правило DNS (у лаунчера такого
  вида нет, и контракт его не объявил) и json-правило, текст которого не
  разбирается. Цепочка внутри папки на телефоне не
  хранится — такая запись называется предупреждением.

  Папка из файла сопоставляется сперва по `id`, затем по имени — только среди
  уже существовавших, поэтому две папки с одинаковым именем больше не
  сливаются, а повторный импорт собственного экспорта ничего не задваивает.
  Одинаковые DNS-правила внутри файла ввозятся все, дубль против уже
  имеющихся — нет. Префикс тегов переводится между сторонами: у лаунчера
  разделитель входит в префикс.

  Попутно: WG-INI-конфиги с комментарием в первой строке при импорте больше не
  считаются одним и тем же сервером.

### Changed

- **Хранение настроек в форме контракта 1.0 ([§439](docs/spec/tasks/439F-storage-contract-1-0/spec.md)).**
  `lxbox_settings.json` хранит источники, цепочки, правила и DNS теми же
  записями, что файл LX Backup 1.0 и состояние десктопного лаунчера 1.6.0.
  Модели и экраны не менялись; конфиг, собранный из одного состояния до и
  после перехода, совпадает байт в байт (golden-тесты на синтетике и снимке
  стенда, проверка на эмуляторе поверх 2.23.2 с богатым состоянием).
  Исключение — detour члена папки на соседа, записанный вручную тегом с
  префиксом папки (`EU de-1`): 2.23.2 не считала его звеном цепочки папки, и
  сосед оставался в группах Направлений. Теперь это то же звено, что голый тег
  `de-1`, который писал UI, и сосед уходит из групп по флагам папки.

  | Было (2.23.2) | Стало |
  |---|---|
  | `server_lists[]` (`type: subscription\|user\|folder`) + `chains[]` с `order` | `sources[]` (`kind: subscription\|server\|folder`), цепочки — записями `kind: chain` в хвосте |
  | `custom_rules[]` с ключами camelCase | `rules[]`: `body` с ключами sing-box, `refs[]`, `ref`, `vars` |
  | правило вида json | `inline` + `verbatim: true`; массив — отдельными правилами «имя», «имя #2»… |
  | `dns_options{servers, rules, rules_json}` | `dns{servers, rules}`, записи `user\|preset\|template`, preset-сервер — `ref: "<preset>:<tag>"`; `rules_json` удалён |
  | `raw_body` сервера, `raw` члена папки | `origin{kind, raw}` + `tag` разобранного узла |
  | член папки `autogroup://…` | запись `kind: auto` с `group{members, strategy}` |
  | `disabled_hashes` в ISO-8601 | `disabled` в unix seconds |
  | — | `storage_version: 1` |

  Переход выполняется один раз при первом чтении файла (старт, загрузка
  Workspaces, восстановление внутреннего бэкапа 2.23.2, `POST /backup/import`).
  До записи исходные байты копируются в `lxbox_settings.json.v0.bak`, у слота
  Workspaces — в папку слота; копия не перезаписывается. Потери (нечитаемые
  записи, битое json-правило, нечисловой порт, формы DNS старше §044)
  называются в журнале.

  **Откат на 2.23.2 не поддерживается.** Внутренний бэкап 2.24.0 версия 2.23.2
  не читает (allowlist отбросит источники, правила и DNS), файл LX Backup 1.0
  и файл правил `format: 2` она отвергает. Бэкапы 2.23.2 и файлы лаунчера до
  1.6.0 читаются. Для стендов — `GET /backup/export?include=storage&from=v0_bak`.

- **Ссылки на узлы — `{folder_id, tag}` ([§439](docs/spec/tasks/439F-storage-contract-1-0/spec.md), D-112/113/114).**
  detour подписки, сервера и папки, личный detour члена папки, позиции
  цепочек и состав узла автовыбора хранят ссылку «контейнер + сырой тег», а
  не финальный тег конфига. Финальный тег считает только сборка.

  | Ситуация | Было | Стало |
  |---|---|---|
  | переименование узла (правка тела), перенос в другую папку, вынос из папки, смена префикса одиночного сервера | ссылка по старому тегу висла: detour снимался на сборке, цепочка с такой позицией выпадала | ссылки переписываются сразу |
  | смена префикса тегов папки или подписки | то же: ссылки держали тег с префиксом | ссылка держит сырой тег, префикс на неё не влияет |
  | удаление узла или источника | позиции цепочек снимались со счётчиком, detour висел | detour снимается, позиция уходит из цепочки, член — из узла автовыбора; SnackBar называет задетые источники, цепочки и группы, членов групп считает отдельно |
  | detour на узел, которого нет в конфиге | ключ `detour` удалялся, узел шёл напрямую | узел выпадает из конфига с предупреждением (каскадом — и те, кто ходил через него; кольцо — все участники) |

  Сырые теги групп подписки уникализируются общим счётчиком с узлами: группы
  получают имена после всех узлов, отметки выключенных узлов не сдвигаются.
  Ссылки из 2.23.2 переводятся по состоянию до перехода; неоднозначная ссылка
  остаётся корневой с предупреждением, detour узла на самого себя и ребро,
  замыкавшее кольцо в папке, снимаются.

- **Файл правил Routing — `format: 2`.** Экспорт выбранных правил пишет записи
  хранения 1.0 (поля LxBox едут все: TTL srs, verbatim, описание и переменные
  DNS-сервера). Файлы `format: 1` читаются.

- **Редактор json-правила не сохраняет массив.** Одно правило держит один
  JSON-объект; для массива редактор просит завести объекты отдельными
  правилами.

- **Debug API ([§439](docs/spec/tasks/439F-storage-contract-1-0/spec.md), [справка](docs/api/debug-api-reference.md)).**

  | Эндпоинт | Было | Стало |
  |---|---|---|
  | `GET /state/storage` | ключи `server_lists`, `custom_rules`, `dns_options`, `chains` | форма хранения 1.0; скраббер маскирует `url` подписки, `origin.raw` сервера → длина, `nodes[]` папки → счётчик |
  | `PUT /settings/dns_options/servers`, `/rules` | kind-ref 2.23.2, снимок без `kind`, строка `rules_json` | только записи `dns{}` 1.0; прочее — 400 с образцом записи |
  | `PATCH /subs/{id}` `override_detour`, `PATCH /folders/{id}/members/{idx}` `detour`, `/chains` `hops` | строки-теги | ссылки `{folder_id?, tag}` в запросе и ответе; строка читается как `{tag}` (у папки — как сырой тег соседа) |
  | `GET /chains` | запись хранения с `order` | `tag`, `label`, `enabled` + канон `source_chain.schema.json` |
  | `GET /backup/export` | — | `from=v0_bak` — блок `storage` из `.v0.bak` (404 без копии) |
  | `POST /backup/import` | — | блок `storage` без `storage_version` мигрирует; `applied.migrated`, `applied.migration` |

- **Значения переменных шаблонного DNS-сервера и пресета правила живут в записи ([§441](docs/spec/tasks/441-template-preset-vars-in-record.md), [§443](docs/spec/tasks/443-contract-1-0-2-spec129.md), SPEC 129 лаунчера, контракт 1.0.2).**
  Касается `vars` у DNS-серверов из шаблона (Google, Cloudflare, AdGuard…) и
  у пресетов правил (RU direct, BitTorrent…).

  | Ситуация | Было | Стало |
  |---|---|---|
  | перенос между LxBox и лаунчером | из переменных DNS-сервера лаунчер переносил только маршрут, корневым `dns_<тег>_outbound`, и LxBox отбрасывал его с `backup_var_skipped`; адрес (`dns_ip`), профиль и резолвер не ехали; `vars` записи из файла к уже заведённому серверу не применялись | едут все переменные записью сервера и накладываются на свой сервер по именам; корневые `dns_<тег>_<имя>` из файла лаунчера переносятся в запись (если некуда — `backup_var_skipped` с причиной) |
  | значение, равное умолчанию шаблона | хранилось как выбор пользователя: смена умолчания в новой версии шаблона до такого пользователя не доходила | не хранится ни в настройках, ни в файле; выбор умолчания в редакторе — сброс к шаблону. Кто не выбирал, получает новое умолчание. Имя, которого шаблон не объявил, снимается |
  | импорт DNS-сервера с целью маршрута, которой на приёмнике нет | сервер ввозился включённым | ввозится выключенным с `backup_unknown_outbound`; значение сохраняется |
  | цель маршрута DNS-сервера не существует на сборке (Направление удалено, значение из чужого файла) | сборка снимала `detour`, и сервер ходил напрямую, мимо VPN | сервер не попадает в конфиг (предупреждение сборки); DNS-правила на него становятся `reject`; `dns.final` на него снимается, и последним DNS-правилом встаёт `reject` без условий — запрос не уходит к первому серверу списка (системному); резолверы (`route`, узлов, DNS-серверов) заменяются умолчанием шаблона или первым пригодным сервером, у DNS-сервера с IP-адресом ключ снимается; DNS-группа, опустевшая от этого, выпадает так же ([§443](docs/spec/tasks/443-contract-1-0-2-spec129.md)). В настройки ничего не пишется |
  | удаление или выключение Направления, на которое указывает DNS-сервер (`outbound` шаблонного, `detour` пользовательского — и в секциях узла) или переменная-цель пресета | правила переводились на vpn-1, а DNS-серверы и прочие переменные-цели пресета оставались на удалённом теге | переводятся на vpn-1 так же; значение переменной, совпавшее с умолчанием шаблона, снимается. SnackBar добавляет «N DNS server(s) switched to vpn-1», Debug API — `healed.dns_servers` |

  `vars` у DNS-записи вида `user` или `preset` в файле 1.0 не применяется и
  называется `backup_unknown_field`. Конфиг из тех же настроек не меняется:
  умолчание в записи и его отсутствие подставляются одинаково. Загрузчик
  шаблона отвергает `@name` в теле шаблонного DNS-сервера, не объявленный в
  `vars[]` этого сервера ([§443](docs/spec/tasks/443-contract-1-0-2-spec129.md)).

- **Ядро обновлено до `v1.14.0-lx.39`** (пин был `lx.38`; [docs/KERNEL.md](docs/KERNEL.md)).
  Хотфикс SPEC 085 форка: часть SOCKS5-прокси отвечает на UDP ASSOCIATE
  адресом релея `0.0.0.0` или `::`; ядро диалило его как есть, то есть
  локальную систему, и UDP молча не ходил при рабочем TCP. Теперь адрес релея
  заменяется адресом прокси-сервера, как у Xray. Java-поверхность libbox не
  изменилась.

### Fixed

- Главный экран: подсказка поля Направления («Направление» в ru) и длинное имя Направления — в одну строку с многоточием; раньше текст переносился и обрезался пополам.
- **REALITY: отпечаток узла снова уходит в конфиг как есть ([§444](docs/spec/tasks/444-reality-fingerprint-no-override.md), D-119 лаунчера, контракт 1.0.3).**
  2.23.2 подменяла у REALITY-узлов отпечаток `firefox` и другие на `chrome` —
  соединение с частью серверов не устанавливалось. Отпечаток узла из подписки
  уходит в конфиг как есть: приложение не переписывает выбор источника.

  | Отпечаток под REALITY | 2.23.2 | 2.24.0 |
  |---|---|---|
  | `firefox`, `safari`, `randomized` и другие не из chrome-семейства | в конфиг `chrome` | как есть |
  | не задан, пустой, `random` | `chrome` | `chrome` |
  | вне словаря ядра | `chrome` + предупреждение | без изменений |

  Предупреждение на узле остаётся, но больше не утверждает, что используется
  `chrome`: серверы Xray с v26.9.8 отвергают такой ClientHello, и если
  соединение не устанавливается, стоит попробовать `chrome`. `random` в модели
  от неявного дефолта парсера неотличим, поэтому под REALITY и явный `fp=random`
  уходит `chrome` — как у лаунчера.

- **Узел Tailscale: связь с пирами и импорт из многоузлового конфига ([§437](docs/spec/tasks/437-tailscale-bundle-import.md)).**
  Было: устройство входило в tailnet и было видно в консоли, но связи с пирами
  не давало. Правило узла матчило только подсеть `100.64.0.0/10`, а при
  включённом FakeIP имя `host.tailnet.ts.net` получает фиктивный адрес и по
  `ip_cidr` не матчится — трафик уходил в маршрут по умолчанию; UDP не проходил
  и без FakeIP (ядру нужен адрес до роутинга). Стало: правило узла матчит имя
  `.ts.net` **или** обе подсети tailnet (v4 и v6 — вторая нужна при
  `prefer_ipv6`/`ipv6_only`), а перед маршрутом стоит резолв через DNS-сервер
  самого узла. Записей в связке по-прежнему три.

  Было: вставка целого конфига, где рядом с Tailscale есть хотя бы один прокси
  («рабочий конфиг из другого клиента»), давала подписку, а у узлов подписки
  связки не бывает — маршрута в tailnet не появлялось. Стало: узлы Tailscale
  из такой вставки становятся отдельными серверами со своей связкой, остальные
  узлы едут прежним путём. Узел Tailscale, добавленный вообще без записей
  (голое тело, конфиг без ссылок на его тег) — хоть вставкой, хоть членом папки
  — получает связку по умолчанию; снять её можно в секциях узла. Узел Tailscale
  внутри подписки связку по-прежнему не получает — теперь об этом говорит
  строка в логе.

  Подсказка под полем Exit node в мастере называет формат (IP Tailscale или имя
  машины-пира, анонсирующей exit node) и то, что интернет через него идёт при
  выборе узла Направлением.

- **Импорт бэкапа выключал правила с целью `direct-out` ([§439](docs/spec/tasks/439F-storage-contract-1-0/spec.md) §6.5).**
  Служебный `direct-out` шаблона не считался известной целью, и правило
  приезжало выключенным с `backup_unknown_outbound`. Ошибка была и в 2.23.2.

- **DNS-правила, записанные моделью, не попадали в конфиг ([§439](docs/spec/tasks/439F-storage-contract-1-0/spec.md) §6.5).**
  Пользовательское правило без ключа `enabled` (так его пишут импорт бэкапа и
  Debug API) сборка пропускала; srs-правило с телом в `body` в конфиг не
  попадало никогда. Сборка читает правила через модели.

- **Одинаковые DNS-правила файла бэкапа схлопывались в одно при импорте.**
  Теперь ввозятся все, в порядке файла; безымянные получают имя из тела с
  уникализацией.

- **Debug API `GET /state/storage` не скрывал длину тела одиночного сервера.**
  Скраббер искал ключ `rawBody`, а в файле был `raw_body`.

- **VPN не стартовал с группой автовыбора, у которой `interval` больше `idle_timeout` ([§442](docs/spec/tasks/442-urltest-interval-idle-pair.md)).**
  Было: подписка с редкой проверкой узлов (`interval: 3h` у Xray-балансера,
  `1d` у группы sing-box) или Направление с интервалом больше тайм-аута
  простоя давали конфиг, который ядро отвергало при старте: `interval must be
  less or equal than idle_timeout`. Тайм-аут у таких групп не задан или
  равен 30m. Стало: сборка поднимает `idle_timeout` до `interval` и пишет
  предупреждение с обоими значениями; `interval` не меняется, чтобы не
  проверять серверы чаще, чем задал провайдер. В редакторе Направления
  красное «Interval must be ≤ idle timeout» заменено серой подсказкой, до
  какого значения поднимется idle timeout; та же подсказка — в редакторе узла
  автовыбора.

- **Ошибки сборок 2.24.0 до выпуска, найденные проверкой на эмуляторе поверх 2.23.2 ([§439](docs/spec/tasks/439F-storage-contract-1-0/spec.md) §5.3).**
  В 2.23.2 их не было.

  | Было | Стало |
  |---|---|
  | preset-сервер DNS получал тег `ru-direct:ru-direct:x`: резолвер не узнавал запись, заводил новую и терял выключатель и описание; слияние файла давало дубли | тег сервера и `ref` записи — одна строка `<пресет>:<тег>`; двойной префикс ранних сборок читается терпимо и не пишется |
  | миграция ссылок писала в журнал «matches no node» про detour на выключенный сервер или узел выключенной папки | такие цели находятся по тегам, которые дала бы сборка при включении |
  | член папки `autogroup://…` из файла `lx_backup: 1` ввозился нечитаемым членом рядом с группой | ввозится группой автовыбора, повторный импорт вторую не заводит; ключ без члена папки снимается из состава с `backup_group_degraded` |
  | SnackBar удаления узла, бывшего членом группы автовыбора, называл его detour'ом («detour removed from 2 source(s)») | члены групп — отдельной строкой «N group member(s) removed» с именами групп |
  | «Move out of folder» у узла автовыбора в папке и «Keep servers» при удалении папки делали из группы пустой одиночный сервер | у группы пункта «Move out of folder» нет; при «Keep servers» группа удаляется, подтверждение называет её («Auto nodes are deleted with the folder: …»), папке из одних групп «Keep servers» не предлагается; Debug `POST /folders/{id}/members/{idx}/ungroup` на группе — 409 |
  | восстановление внутреннего бэкапа 2.23.2, Debug `POST /backup/import` и `replaceRaw` теряли цепочки с позицией на узел подписки (и цепочки, ссылавшиеся на них) | ссылки мигрируют с телами подписок из `sub_cache`, как при старте |
  | неразрешённый detour давал строку предупреждения на каждый выпавший узел: папка на 138 узлов с одной висячей ссылкой — 138 строк | одна строка на ссылку и причину: первые пять имён и «and N more» ([§377](docs/spec/tasks/377-detour-removed-warning-aggregation.md)) |

### Removed

- Форма члена папки `autogroup://…` и её парсер: узел автовыбора хранится
  записью `kind: auto`.
- `dns_options.rules_json`, строковый `PUT /settings/dns_options/rules` и
  приём в `PUT /settings/dns_options/servers` форм DNS-сервера старше §044
  (миграция `_migrateLegacyDnsServers`).
- Поле `order` цепочки в хранении и Debug API: место цепочки — её индекс в
  списке.

---

## [2.23.2] — 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Узел Tailscale и «секции узла» ([§435](docs/spec/tasks/435-node-sections-tailscale.md), контракт ## 13).**
  Узел `type: tailscale` из sing-box JSON принимается без адреса и собирается в
  `endpoints[]` со своим каталогом состояния; на ядре без Tailscale он хранится,
  а при сборке пропускается с предупреждением. Свободный узел (одиночный или в
  папке) носит с собой связку — правила маршрута и DNS-записи — в поле
  `sections` в форме контракта 1.0; `@self` в них означает финальный тег узла и
  подставляется при сборке. Целый sing-box-конфиг с одним узлом импортируется
  вместе со связкой. Узел без `exit_node` не попадает в Направления. В бэкап
  секции до контракта 1.0 не едут (экспорт называет потерю). Ядро релиза —
  `v1.14.0-lx.38` с Tailscale в AAR: узел собирается и работает; на более
  старом ядре он хранится, а при сборке пропускается с предупреждением.

### Changed

- **Выпуск в Google Play уезжает из CI сам ([§436](docs/spec/tasks/436-google-play-upload-ci.md)).**
  На тег `vX.Y.Z` CI, собрав AAB, заливает его в Play Console через Google
  Play Developer API от имени сервисного аккаунта. Трек и статус выпуска
  задаются переменными репозитория (`PLAY_TRACK`, `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS`; по
  умолчанию `production` и `draft` — черновик публикует человек). Описание
  выпуска берётся из тех же файлов `fastlane/…/changelogs/`, что читает
  F-Droid; их длина (≤ 500 символов) теперь проверяется на каждом push.
  Релиз-кандидаты `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` в Play не уходят, на GitHub публикуются как
  pre-release и не обновляют `docs/latest.json`, так что проверка обновлений
  их не предлагает; hotfix-теги — полноценный релиз.
  F-Droid подхватывает теги сам и без этого.

- **Правило маршрута может нести несколько rule-set’ов ([§434](docs/spec/tasks/434-srs-rule-multiple-rule-sets.md)).**
  В поле URL srs-правила теперь по одному адресу на строку. Ядро получает
  `rule_set` на каждый файл и одно правило со списком; с одним адресом конфиг
  не меняется. У каждого файла свой кэш и своё автообновление, правило
  включается только когда скачаны все. В бэкапе список едет полем `refs`
  контракта (`ref` остаётся первым адресом), файл с десктопа с таким правилом
  импортируется без потерь.

- **Узлы NaïveProxy: отброшенный заголовок из `extra-headers` теперь виден на узле ([§433](docs/spec/tasks/433-reality-fp-not-chrome-naive-extra-headers-codes.md)).**
  Пара без `:` или с недопустимым именем и раньше выбрасывалась при разборе
  ссылки, но об этом было написано только в логе. Теперь у узла появляется
  информационное предупреждение с отброшенной парой; остальные заголовки и
  сам узел не меняются. Для REALITY-узлов с отпечатком не из семейства Chrome
  предупреждение существовало с §281; оно привязано к коду контракта 0.12.10,
  а в конфиг под REALITY отпечаток `chrome` теперь пишется явно и в тех
  случаях, когда в узле его нет вовсе.

- **QR-сканер: движок распознавания обновлён до zxing-cpp 3.1.1 ([§432](docs/spec/tasks/432-flutter-zxing-3.md)).**
  Плагин `flutter_zxing` 2.4 → 3.0. Лучше берутся мелкие коды и QR первой
  версии, сканирование на ARM быстрее на 10–40%. Кроме обычного QR теперь
  читаются Micro QR и rMQR с той же ссылкой внутри. Экран сканера и его
  настройки не менялись.

- **Ядро обновлено до `v1.14.0-lx.38`** (пин был `lx.34`; [docs/KERNEL.md](docs/KERNEL.md)).
  `lx.38` — Tailscale в Android AAR (`with_tailscale` + `ts_omit_*`; размер AAR
  +2,6 МБ, время сборки не выросло) и хотфикс SPEC 084 ядра (ABBA-дедлок
  вложенных selector'ов, issue #20 форка); база апстрима — sing-box 1.14.0 + 33
  коммита, сабмодули wireguard-go v0.0.6 / sing-tun v0.9.3. Java-поверхность
  libbox не изменилась. Ниже — что принесли `lx.35`/`lx.36` по дороге. `lx.35` — хотфикс issue #14 ядра: XHTTP за CDN, сбрасывающим
  HTTP/2-стримы, мог держать 100 % CPU до перезапуска (ошибка сброса утекала
  типом HTTP/2-библиотеки в клиента, идущего сквозь узел, — DoH с `detour`,
  rule-set, цепочки). `lx.36` — REALITY против Xray-core ≥ 26.9.8: ядро само
  вырезало из приветствия постквантовый ключ, который сервер теперь требует,
  и все REALITY-узлы на обновлённых серверах молча умирали; см. запись §281
  в Fixed. Проверено на AVD против локального Xray 26.9.9: с `lx.34` узлы
  падали с `reality verification failed`, с `lx.36` ходят.

- **Обновлены плагины выбора и отправки файлов; убраны неиспользуемые codegen-пакеты ([§431](docs/spec/tasks/431-file-picker-12-plus-plugins-major-bump.md)).**
  Play Console указал на устаревший `file_picker` (декодирование картинок без
  ограничения размера — путь, который приложение не использует, но ветка 11.x
  исправление уже не получит). Подняты `file_picker` 12, `share_plus` 13,
  `device_info_plus` 13, `package_info_plus` 10, `connectivity_plus` 7 и
  зависимости по мелочи. Выбранный файл теперь приходит в экраны уже
  прочитанным (`PickedFile`): импорт конфига, бэкапа, правил и подписок
  читает текст одинаково через UTF-8 — три экрана раньше декодировали байты
  как UTF-16 и портили кириллицу в именах. Из проекта удалены `freezed`,
  `json_serializable`, `build_runner` и их аннотации — ни одной
  сгенерированной модели в коде не было. Ушла и библиотека Apache Tika
  (465 классов), которую тянул старый `file_picker`.

### Fixed

- **REALITY-узлы с отпечатком не из семейства Chrome больше не умирают молча на серверах Xray 26.9.8+ ([§281](docs/spec/tasks/281-utls-fingerprint-normalize.md), ядро SPEC 083).**
  Обновлённый REALITY-сервер требует в приветствии постквантовый ключ
  `X25519MLKEM768`, который из всех отпечатков несёт только Chrome; узел с
  `firefox`, `safari`, `ios` и им подобными сервер молча уводит на камуфляжный
  сайт, и туннель не поднимается без единой ошибки. Теперь такой узел получает
  предупреждение при импорте, а в конфиг ядра уходит `chrome`; сохранённое в
  узле значение не меняется. Дефолтный `random` подменяется без предупреждения.
  Сама ошибка на стороне ядра (оно вырезало этот ключ даже у Chrome) закрыта
  ядром `v1.14.0-lx.36`.

- **Иконка приложения больше не в белой рамке.**
  На Android 8 и новее система сама заворачивала старую иконку в адаптивную:
  уменьшала её и подкладывала белый фон — эта рамка была видна и в лаунчере, и
  в каталоге F-Droid. Теперь у приложения есть настоящая адаптивная иконка из
  двух слоёв: оранжевый градиент во весь фон и графика, вписанная в безопасную
  зону, поэтому под любой маской (круг, скруглённый квадрат) она смотрится
  цельной. Иконки для старых версий Android и для каталога получили прозрачные
  углы вместо белых.

- **Зависшее уведомление «VPN работает» от убитого процесса снимается при открытии приложения ([§430](docs/spec/tasks/430-stale-fgs-notification-cleanup.md)).**
  Жалоба с 4PDA: в шторке «L×Box [final = vpn-1] • 14 ч.», в приложении
  Start. Процесс убит системой, туннеля нет, а уведомление foreground-сервиса
  остаётся из-за гонки в самом Android (интерфейс исчезает раньше сигнала о
  смерти процесса, и запись сервиса стирается без снятия уведомления). Снять
  его приложение не может, поэтому при открытии сервис на мгновение
  поднимается под тем же уведомлением и штатно останавливается, и уведомление
  снимает сама система.
- **Кнопки и хвосты списков больше не уезжают под системную панель навигации ([§429](docs/spec/tasks/429-bottom-inset-system-navigation.md)).**
  Жалоба с 4PDA: «Save» в шторке DNS-правила наполовину под трёхкнопочной
  панелью. Все шторки переведены на общий `showAppBottomSheet` с отступом под
  клавиатуру и панель; 18 экранов со списками (About, Backup, Speed test,
  мастера WARP/Add server, редакторы направлений, логи, Stats, Debug, список
  узлов, редактор конфига, QR) получили нижний отступ; два контракт-теста
  не дают вернуть проблему.

## [2.23.1] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **Регион использования — общая настройка приложения ([§425](docs/spec/tasks/425-warp-pool-region-loc.md)).**
  Плитка App Settings → General → Region рядом с языком: `Auto` (страна сети,
  иначе локаль), `Not set` или явный код страны. Первый потребитель — пул SNI
  генератора WARP: в `assets/warp_endpoints.json` появились региональные секции
  `loc.<cc>`, которые накладываются на корень (Map сливается по ключам, списки
  заменяются целиком; `{"alias": "xx"}` — ссылка на другую секцию). Российские
  домены (`yandex.ru`, `gosuslugi.ru`, …) уехали в `loc.ru` — за пределами
  российского DPI они были шумом; `deepseek.com` остался в корне.
- **About: все источники установки видны всегда ([§426](docs/spec/tasks/426-install-sources-always-in-about.md)).**
  Карточка «Where to get L×Box» с GitHub, Google Play и F-Droid под блоком
  обновлений; текущий канал помечен. Раньше ссылка на стор появлялась только
  когда чекер находил новую версию. Подвал объясняет порядок переезда между
  источниками (у каждого свой ключ подписи: бэкап → удалить → поставить →
  восстановить).

### Fixed

- **WARP-визард: пометка «(recommended)» больше не утекает в конфиг ([§424](docs/spec/tasks/424-warp-preset-recommended-mark-leak.md)).**
  Выбор рекомендованного пункта в combobox писал в узел
  `"server_name": "consumer-masque.cloudflareclient.com (recommended)"`:
  `DropdownMenu` кладёт в контроллер `entry.label`, а не `value`. Теперь
  `label` — всегда чистое значение, пометка живёт в `labelWidget`. Затронуты
  были все три combobox-а с пометкой: MASQUE SNI, MASQUE Endpoint IP, WG
  endpoint.
- **Чужой VPN из рабочего профиля больше не считается конфликтующим; краш Start на Android 10 ([§427](docs/spec/tasks/427-foreign-vpn-active-network-api30.md), issue #115).**
  Проверка перед стартом смотрит только дефолтную сеть приложения, а не все
  сети устройства: VPN внутри Shelter / work profile живёт в своём слоте и
  диалог «Another VPN is active» на него не срабатывает. Заодно закрыт краш на
  Android 10: `getOwnerUid()` существует только с API 30, а прежний гейт стоял
  на 29, и `NoSuchMethodError` пролетал мимо ловушки.
- **Туннель возвращается после гибели процесса ([§428](docs/spec/tasks/428-vpn-service-start-sticky.md), issue #115).**
  Сервис теперь `START_STICKY`, плюс сторож на AlarmManager: если процесс
  убил OOM, lmkd или OEM-чистилка, VPN поднимается сам без открытия
  приложения, в том числе под Always-on. Один `START_STICKY` не спасает:
  в system_server снятие tun-интерфейса обгоняет обработку смерти процесса,
  и запись сервиса зависает без рестарта. Сторож взводится только пока
  туннель поднят и в здоровом состоянии не будит телефон. Ручной Stop не
  воскрешается. Предохранитель: не больше двух автоперезапусков за пять
  минут, дальше остановка с уведомлением.
- **`RECORD_AUDIO` убран из APK.** Разрешение просачивалось в манифест из
  `camera_android_camerax` (сканер QR); микрофон приложение не использует —
  снято через `tools:node="remove"`.

### Changed

- **Тулчейн сборки:** Gradle 8.14 → 9.3.1, AGP 8.11.1 → 9.1.0, Kotlin
  2.2.20 → 2.3.21 (`kotlinOptions` → `compilerOptions`).
- **Документация:** `docs/FDROID.md` переписан по актуальному состоянию
  рецепта (два ABI, пины srclib к коммитам, потолок джоба 3 ч, раздел
  Permissions); пин ядра в `srclibs` на сборку не влияет — prebuild сам
  делает checkout по `libbox.version`. Добавлена страница
  `docs/GOOGLE_PLAY.md` про публикацию в Play.

---

## [2.23.0] — 2026-09-05

### Added

- **AmneziaWG 3.0/3.1 ([§421](docs/spec/tasks/421-awg3-header-protection-timings.md)).**
  Импорт экспортов Amnezia с `protocol_version: "3.1"` (контейнер
  `amnezia-awg2`) по всем путям — `.conf`, `wireguard://`/`awg://`, `vpn://`,
  sing-box JSON. Что было → стало:

  | Было | Стало |
  |---|---|
  | `HeaderProtectionKey`, `ContentPaddingAddition`, `RekeyAfterTime`, `RekeyTimeout`, `RejectAfterTime`, `KeepaliveTimeout`, `MaxHandshakeAttempts`, `RandomTrailers`, `DisableCookies` молча выбрасывались | доезжают до ядра одноимёнными snake_case-ключами корня endpoint; `N-M` — строкой, `N` — числом, булевы — `true` только при `on` |
  | `PersistentKeepalive = 25-35` терялся (`int.tryParse`) | `persistent_keepalive_interval: "25-35"` |
  | `last_config.mtu` экспорта не читался; узел только с AWG3-полями не считался AmneziaWG | `MTU` берётся из `last_config.mtu`, если его нет в `[Interface]`; AWG3-маркер сам делает узел AmneziaWG — кламп до 1280 как у AWG2 (на 1376 из экспорта данные у владельца не шли), явно меньшее значение уважается |
  | — | политика ошибок как у лаунчера (SPEC 123): битый тайминг/булево — поле снято (`awg3_field_invalid`), битый ключ защиты или `s1`–`s4` < 12 — узел выброшен (`awg3_header_key_invalid`, `awg3_padding_too_short`), `random_trailers` + широкий диапазон `h1`–`h4` — info |
  | лейблы `awg`/`awg1.5`/`awg2` | + `awg3` (любой AWG3-ключ или диапазонный keepalive), `awg3.1` (`random_trailers`/`disable_cookies`), суффикс `+` при masquerade |
  | ядро `v1.14.0-lx.30` | `v1.14.0-lx.34` (ядро ≤ lx.31 отвергает конфиг с AWG3-ключами целиком; `lx.34` переводит базу на стабильный апстрим 1.14.0) |

  Share-URI и экспорт `.conf` пишут булевы как `on`; round-trip без потерь.
  Контракт с лаунчером: корпус `awg3_full_params`, `amnezia_vpn_awg3`,
  `awg3_header_key_short_dropped` зелёный.

- **Workspaces — именованные наборы настроек ([§417](docs/spec/tasks/417F-workspaces/spec.md)).**
  Кнопка справа от «L×Box» на главном экране: список сохранённых наборов,
  «Сохранить как…», управление. Набор — копия всего состояния: подписки с
  кэшем узлов, Направления, цепочки, правила, DNS, приложения туннеля, режим
  работы, настройки. Загрузка сначала сохраняет текущее состояние под его
  именем (терять нечего), затем перечитывает настройки на месте — без
  перезапуска приложения — и пересобирает конфиг; включённый VPN
  останавливается и поднимается снова. Пока ничего не сохранено, на диске
  ничего не меняется.

### Changed

- **Ядро обновлено до `v1.14.0-lx.34`** (было `v1.14.0-lx.30`). Помимо
  AWG 3.x (`lx.32`/`lx.33`, см. §421 выше) `lx.34` переводит форк со
  среднеавгустовской беты 1.14 на выпущенный апстримом **sing-box 1.14.0
  stable** плюс 16 пострелизных коммитов. Конфиги и формат на проводе не
  меняются. Что видно из приложения: URL-тест больше не зависает на узле,
  который принял соединение и молчит (у каждой пробы свой дедлайн 15 с);
  ручной тест группы пробует все узлы и заходит во вложенные группы;
  discovery-запросы `_dns.*` SVCB получают пустой NOERROR, и браузер не уходит
  на внешний DoH мимо туннеля; инвертированные DNS-правила с адресными
  фильтрами из rule-set снова матчатся; скорость QUIC на TUIC и naive не
  проседает после простоя; у системного стека своя таблица TCP NAT на каждое
  семейство адресов. Java-поверхность только аддитивна (javap по 253 классам) —
  правок обвязки нет.

- **Support-лента: сеть только с согласия на проверку обновлений ([§422](docs/spec/tasks/422-support-feed-gated-by-update-consent.md)).**
  Ответил «Skip» на вопрос первого запуска — приложение не делает ни одного
  запроса за лентой. Что было → стало:

  | Было | Стало |
  |---|---|
  | GET `raw.githubusercontent.com/…/support.json` при каждом запуске процесса с поднятым туннелем, независимо от флага и даже при прочитанной ленте | запрос только при `auto_check_updates`; без него — кэш последней удачной загрузки |
  | без сети и без кэша лента молчит | лента вшита в APK на момент сборки — очередь и пороги работают с первого запуска; в кэш она не пишется, при появлении согласия придёт свежая |
  | источник — `docs/support.json`, отдельно от приложения | единственный файл `app/assets/support.json`: он же бандлится, он же раздаётся с GitHub; `docs/support.json` удалён, версии ≤ 2.22.0 после этого живут на своём кэше |

  Повод — вопрос ревьюера F-Droid (#61).

- **Способы поддержки: единственный источник `app/assets/donate.json` ([§423](docs/spec/tasks/423-donate-json-single-source.md)).**
  Та же схема: файл бандлится и раздаётся с GitHub, `docs/donate.json`
  удалён (копии успели разойтись). Гейта нет — попап About → Support читает
  его только по клику, фоновых запросов у него не было и нет.

- **Get WARP: регистрация через `api.devices.cloudflare.com`, старый хост — запасной ([§418](docs/spec/tasks/418-warp-api-host-failover.md)).**
  `api.cloudflareclient.com` из России не отвечает на TCP вовсе, и «Get WARP»
  падал по таймауту. Хосты API теперь перечислены в asset
  `warp_endpoints.json` (`api.hosts`): первый — `api.devices.cloudflare.com`
  (тот же путь, заголовки и ответ, доступен напрямую), при сетевой ошибке или
  таймауте — следующий. Таймаут на запрос к одному хосту 5 с (было 15). Все шаги одной регистрации (MASQUE-enroll, WARP+
  лицензия) идут на хост, который ответил. В MASQUE-регистрации первый POST
  теперь несёт настоящий X25519-ключ вместо случайных байт — новый хост
  строже проверяет ключ. Наводка на хост — [PR #101](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/pull/101) от [@eleutherifer](https://github.com/eleutherifer)
  (форк [eleutherifer/LxBox](https://github.com/eleutherifer/LxBox)).
- **MASQUE: пул точек входа разложен по транспортам ([§420](docs/spec/tasks/420-masque-pool-per-transport.md)).**
  Замер живыми туннелями показал, что в блоках Cloudflare `162.159.198.*`
  и `162.159.199.*` адреса `.1` дают только h3 (QUIC), `.2` — h3 и h2, а
  остальные — только h2. Раньше список «Endpoint IP» в мастере WARP был
  один на все транспорты, и выбор `.1` при HTTP/2 давал мёртвый узел, а
  рекомендуемым стояло имя `consumer-masque.cloudflareclient.com`, у
  которого нет DNS-записи. Теперь список зависит от транспорта, при
  переключении неподходящий пресет сбрасывается, рекомендуемый —
  `162.159.198.2` (его же отдаёт регистрация), кубик и генератор на h2
  не выдают h3-only адреса. Старый формат JSON в окне эксперимента
  читается как прежде. Правило про адреса `.1`/`.2` — из README форка
  [@eleutherifer](https://github.com/eleutherifer) ([PR #101](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/pull/101)), подтверждено замером.
- **SNI-пулы WARP (WireGuard/AWG и MASQUE): добавлены `deepseek.com`, `mail.ru`,
  `max.ru`, `vk.ru`** — домены из «белых» списков, которые DPI режет реже
  (идея из [PR #101](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/pull/101) от [@eleutherifer](https://github.com/eleutherifer)). Рекомендуемый MASQUE-SNI прежний —
  `consumer-masque.cloudflareclient.com`, как у официального клиента.

### Fixed

- **Плашка «Settings changed» висела вечно после удаления пресета ([§419](docs/spec/tasks/419-dangling-dns-resolver-heal-in-build.md)).**
  Если резольвером (`dns.final` / `default_domain_resolver`) был выбран DNS-сервер
  пресета, а пресет потом выключили или удалили, каждая пересборка падала на
  валидации, конфиг не сохранялся, плашка не снималась, а тап по ней ничего не
  показывал. Автосброс срабатывал только при открытии DNS Settings. Теперь битая
  ссылка лечится в самой сборке (дефолт шаблона, значение записывается в настройки),
  а если пересборка всё же не удалась — причина показывается снеком.

## [2.22.0] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Идентичность узла подписки — его тег ([§400](docs/spec/tasks/400-identity-tag-mirror.md)).**
  Отметка «узел выключен» держалась на хеше содержимого узла, и ротация сервера
  под тем же именем — смена IP, смена группы, правка SNI или кредов провайдером
  — считалась появлением нового узла: отметка молча снималась, выключенный узел
  возвращался в конфиг. Теперь ключ отметки — тег узла (уникализированный
  внутри источника: тёзки получают суффиксы `-2`, `-3`), и она следует за
  узлом через любую правку тела. Смена формы хранения (`uri` ↔ `config_json`) и
  смена префикса подписки идентичность тоже больше не двигают. Обмен
  сознательный: переименование узла провайдером отметку теперь **теряет** —
  имя и есть идентичность.

  Старые отметки переезжают сами при первом разборе источника — сетевом
  обновлении или подъёме тел из кэша на старте; неопознанные снимаются (узла с
  таким содержимым в источнике всё равно нет). Дубли одного сервера под разными
  именами стали разными узлами и гасятся раздельно. Узел без имени
  идентичности не получает — вместо этого ему синтезируется тег, безымянных
  узлов в списке не бывает.

- **Xray-релеи: разные записи больше не схлопываются в одну ([§404](docs/spec/tasks/404-dialer-proxy-signature.md)).**
  Дедуп подписки сравнивал записи по грубому ключу «протокол + адрес + порт +
  креды» и не видел ни транспорта, ни TLS, ни пути дозвона. Один сервер,
  присланный провайдером под двумя SNI или двумя транспортами, приезжал одним
  узлом; пара «прямая запись + BYPASS-запись того же сервера» — тоже, хотя
  BYPASS это другой маршрут, а не резерв, и там, где прямой путь зарезан,
  пользователь оставался без рабочего варианта. Теперь запись опознаётся по
  каноническому телу вместе с полным путём дозвона.

  Заодно `sockopt.dialerProxy`: релей, который сам звонит через следующий
  релей, разбирается многохопом; недостижимый или зацикленный релей теперь
  **отбраковывает владельца** с предупреждением, а не подменяет его узлом с
  прямым путём — провайдер завернул дозвон в релей именно потому, что прямой
  выход нежелателен. Тег звена — собственный тег релея из конфига провайдера;
  маркер `⚙` остался только в списке узлов и в конфиг ядра больше не уезжает.

- **Бюджет теста узлов Направления переносится на десктоп ([§409](docs/spec/tasks/409-direction-ping-options-backup.md)).**
  Персональные URL и таймаут замера Направления (`ping_url`,
  `ping_timeout_ms`) LX-бэкап не переносил вовсе: на новой машине Направление
  оказывалось на глобальном умолчании молча — экспорт о потере не знал.
  Внутренний бэкап их переносил всё это время; расходились ровно два формата.

- **DNS-серверы DoQ и DoH3 в форме редактора ([§411](docs/spec/tasks/411-dns-doq-doh3-form.md)).**
  Типы `quic` (DNS-over-QUIC, порт 853) и `h3` (DNS-over-HTTP/3, порт 443 +
  path) ядро понимало давно, но форма предлагала только UDP / DoT / DoH и
  отправляла всё остальное на вкладку JSON. Селектор типов на телефоне
  теперь всегда выпадающий список: шесть сегментов в строку не помещаются.

- **WARP: `vhttp: auto` принимается на импорте ([§402](docs/spec/tasks/402-direction-chain-label-removed.md)).**
  Ядро понимает `auto` (h3 с откатом на h2) с lx.27, мастер WARP его уже
  предлагал, но оба парсера знали только пару `{h3, h2}` и молча форсили `h3`.
  Узел, созданный мастером, работал, а тот же узел, экспортированный в ссылку
  и заимпортированный обратно, `auto` терял.

### Changed

- **Перенос настроек на десктоп: файл стал сериализацией состояния ([§401](docs/spec/tasks/401-backup-state-serialization.md), [§405](docs/spec/tasks/405-direction-chain-label-mobile-only.md)–[§407](docs/spec/tasks/407-backup-corpus-pre-state-merge.md), [§409](docs/spec/tasks/409-direction-ping-options-backup.md)).**
  Раздел расширений (`extensions`) упразднён: он был карманом, в котором
  непонятое другой стороной провозилось нетронутым — и протухало, когда
  каноническую часть правили на той стороне. Карточка «Перенос на десктоп»
  больше не обещает круг без потерь. Всё, что раньше ехало в кармане и имеет
  смысл на обеих сторонах, переехало в обычные поля файла: identity подписки
  (user-agent, HWID и остальное), папка сервера, имена Направлений и цепочек,
  бюджет теста узлов Направления, плоские `sni` / `idle_timeout` /
  `keep_alive` / `endpoint` / `awg` у записей WARP.

  Остальное честно остаётся на устройстве и **называется вслух**: правила
  импорта подписки, действие по обновлению, политика detour, матчеры по
  приложениям и Wi-Fi, тело правила `kind=json`, настройки пинга папки. При
  экспорте приложение перечисляет, что не попало в файл
  (`backup_local_only_dropped`), при импорте — что было отброшено. Молчаливых
  потерь в обе стороны больше нет.

  Правило, ссылающееся на цель, которой на принимающей стороне нет,
  по-прежнему импортируется **выключенным**, а не теряется и не включается:
  включённое правило с мёртвой целью роняет конфиг ядра целиком.

- **Импорт переноса — слияние по понятному ключу ([§406](docs/spec/tasks/406-import-canonical-body-case-sensitive-tags.md)).**
  Импорт не заменяет состав: локальное, чего в файле нет, остаётся. Подписка
  опознаётся по URL, папка — по имени, сервер — по каноническому телу
  (у ссылки отбрасывается фрагмент после `#`, у JSON — `tag` и `detour`, ключи
  сортируются). Раньше тела сравнивались посимвольно, и один и тот же сервер,
  пересобранный другим сериализатором или подписанный другой ремаркой,
  доливался в список вторым узлом при каждом повторном импорте.

  Теги Направлений, цепочек и целей правил сравниваются **с учётом регистра** —
  как это делает ядро и как это делает форма создания Направления. Раньше
  приехавшее `VPN-DE` при живом `vpn-de` объявлялось тёзкой и терялось молча,
  а правило на `VPN-DE` считалось имеющим известную цель и приезжало
  включённым — ровно в тот отказ конфига ядра, ради предотвращения которого
  гейт и стоит. Настройки подписки с тем же URL применяются из файла;
  отметки выключенных узлов объединяются, а не замещаются. Раздел правил
  по-прежнему единственный, который замещается целиком.

  Норма слияния теперь одна на обе стороны — записана в общем контракте и
  проверяется корпусом с предсостоянием ([§407](docs/spec/tasks/407-backup-corpus-pre-state-merge.md)):
  импорт в пустое состояние не отличал слияние от замены.

- **Пикер приложений: галочка переключается только тапом по ней ([§412](docs/spec/tasks/412-app-picker-checkbox-only-tap.md)).**
  Раньше выбор переключал тап по всей строке, и при прокрутке длинного
  списка палец задевал строку — приложение выпадало из выбора незаметно.
  Теперь реагирует только сам чекбокс со штатной областью касания.

- **Ядро обновлено до `v1.14.0-lx.30`** (было `v1.14.0-lx.28-rc.1`). Починен
  DNS через `detour` на XHTTP-узел: серверы типа `udp`/`tcp`/`tls` за таким
  detour'ом падали на первом же запросе с `write request: context canceled` —
  это выглядело как красные URL-тесты `masque`- и `wireguard`-узлов, если
  проверять их по доменному адресу (по IP тот же узел зелёный), и как мёртвый
  системный DNS через TUN при живом туннеле. Там же: XHTTP больше не держит
  процессор на 100%, когда путь рубит upload-стримы (circuit breaker в
  xmux-пуле), выгрузка `packet-up` переживает graceful `GOAWAY`, закрыта
  утечка пула в `stream-up`. Java-поверхность ядра изменилась только
  дополнениями (RPC цепочек, клиент их не биндит) — правок обвязки не
  потребовалось.

### Fixed

- **Один XHTTP-узел подписки не давал подняться VPN ([§416](docs/spec/tasks/416-xhttp-packet-up-guard.md)).**
  Узел с `uplink_data_placement: header`, но без указанного режима,
  ядро отвергало вместе со ВСЕМ конфигом: такое размещение оно
  принимает только в режиме `packet-up`. Сервис не стартовал вовсе,
  причём из-за узла, который пользователь мог и не выбирать. Теперь на
  сборке конфига режим дописывается сам, и узел собирается так, как
  его ждёт сервер. Если режим задан явно и другой — конфликт разбирать
  за пользователя нельзя, поэтому снимается размещение, а режим
  остаётся нетронутым. В обоих случаях на узле появляется
  предупреждение.

- **Ложная ошибка «Stop timed out» при успешной остановке ([§415](docs/spec/tasks/415-stop-timeout-budget.md)).**
  Остановка тяжёлого туннеля (WARP/AWG с десятками живых соединений) занимает
  около пяти секунд, а внутренний бюджет ожидания был пять — истекал за
  мгновение до того, как остановка успешно завершалась. Туннель гасился
  штатно, но пользователь видел красную ошибку, и поверх уже идущей остановки
  прилетал аварийный force-stop. Бюджеты выстроены по возрастанию:
  ожидание ядра (9с) < вызов из UI (10с) < аварийное добивание (12с) —
  каждый следующий уровень даёт предыдущему договорить. При настоящем
  зависании ядра ошибка по-прежнему показывается, а сервис по-прежнему
  добивается принудительно.

- **Конфиг пересобирался на каждом запуске ([§414](docs/spec/tasks/414-config-dirty-check-files-dir.md)).**
  Проверка «настройки новее конфига» (§076/§113) искала
  `singbox_config.json` в каталоге Flutter (`app_flutter/`), а native пишет
  его в `files/`. Файл «не находился» никогда → на каждом холодном старте
  конфиг считался устаревшим и собирался заново, а выравнивание mtime после
  чистой записи настроек было холостым. Теперь путь к конфигу берётся у
  native (`getFilesDir`, как у диагностики ядра §316): сравнение времени
  файлов работает как задумано, пересборка — только когда настройки
  действительно менялись.

- **Импорт бэкапа с заменой гасил Debug API устройства ([§413](docs/spec/tasks/413-backup-replace-keeps-debug-api.md)).**
  Экспорт по умолчанию не включает токен и порт Debug API, а импорт с
  заменой писал `vars` поверх целиком — сервер отладки после рестарта
  поднимался на дефолтном порту с новым токеном. Теперь ключи Debug API,
  которых нет в файле, остаются устройству; ключи из файла по-прежнему
  побеждают.

- **Сервис не стартовал при XHTTP-узле с `extra` в подписке ([§410](docs/spec/tasks/410-xhttp-extra-empty-not-clobber.md)).**
  Регрессия v2.21.0: `Failed to start service … uplink_data_placement can be
  header only in packet-up mode`, если в подписке есть хоть один XHTTP-узел,
  у которого Xray-ссылка несёт `mode=packet-up` плоским параметром и
  `"mode": ""` внутри `extra`. Пустая строка из `extra` затирала плоское
  значение, ядро брало режим `auto` и отвергало весь конфиг. Теперь пустое
  значение в `extra` плоский параметр не перекрывает (как в Go-эталоне
  лаунчера); непустое по-прежнему в приоритете. Узел собирается с тем
  режимом и размещением uplink, которые сервер ждёт. Ядро тут ни при чём:
  проверка в нём с первой lx-сборки, а в v2.20.12 то же поле сбрасывалось
  парсером с жёлтой плашкой.

  Заодно `host`, `path` и `mode` теперь читаются только из плоских параметров
  ссылки, как делает Xray при слиянии `extra`: у того же узла в `extra`
  лежал `path: "/"`, и сервер отвечал 404, рабочий путь был плоским.

- **Настройки пинга удалённого Направления оставались в хранилище ([§408](docs/spec/tasks/408-ping-options-groups-heal.md)).**
  Персональные URL и timeout Направления (`ping_options.groups`) переживали его
  удаление: ключ висел сиротой, попадал в бэкап, а созданное следом Направление
  с тем же тегом (`vpn-3` освобождается и выдаётся снова) молча наследовало
  чужой адрес проверки. Из пяти мест, где хранится ссылка на тег Направления,
  эта карта была единственной без самолечения. Теперь ключ снимается в той же
  транзакции, что и остальные ссылки — вместе с ключом auto-двойника
  `<tag>-auto`, — а уже накопленные сироты вычищаются при загрузке состава
  Направлений (в том числе после восстановления бэкапа). Выключение
  Направления override по-прежнему не трогает: оно обратимо.

---

## [2.21.0] — 2026-08-25

Каналы стали Направлениями, на мобиле появились цепочки хопов.

### Added

- **Цепочки хопов (SPEC 110).** Третий вид источника рядом с подписками и
  серверами: явный маршрут `вы → хоп 1 → хоп 2 → назначение`. Позициями могут
  быть узлы, группы и Направления — Направление хопом делает этот шаг
  переключаемым на лету. Цепочки живут в общем списке источников равными
  строками: включаются, перетаскиваются, фильтруются, меряются auto-двойником
  Направления. Редактор держит инварианты старта ядра — тот самый класс
  ошибок, который `sing-box check` пропускает, а `run` роняет: минимум две
  позиции, без дублей и самоссылок, вложенные цепочки только в позиции 0,
  ссылки только на цепочки выше. Удаление источника вычищает его позиции с
  видимым счётчиком, а цепочка, упавшая ниже двух позиций, перестаёт
  эмитироваться до починки; обновление подписки позиции не трогает.

- **Послойная диагностика цепочки.** Узел цепочки → «Диагностика»: каждый хоп
  с накопленной задержкой и собственной ценой — `67 ms → 91 ms (+24) →
  96 ms (+5)`. Мёртвый слой показывает текст ошибки ядра и помечает
  остальные «не достигнуто»: «где рвётся маршрут» видно с одного взгляда.

- **Перенос настроек между телефоном и десктопом (LX Backup, контракт 0.7.1).**
  *Резервные копии → Перенос на десктоп.* Общий формат обмена с десктопным
  лаунчером: подписки, серверы, правила, DNS и переносимые переменные едут
  одним файлом. Корневые секции `directions[]` и `chains[]` — правила приезжают
  рабочими; `warp[]` и `dns` ездят в обе стороны; на импорте применяются
  переменные, `route.final` и настройки подписок. То, чему на другой стороне
  места нет, на этот момент провозилось нетронутым в разделе расширений
  (механизм упразднён после релиза — см. Unreleased).

- **Debug API: CRUD `/chains` + `/chains/{tag}/probe`**, справка
  актуализована.

### Changed

- **Каналы переименованы в Направления ([§393](docs/spec/tasks/393-masque-config-schema-migration.md)).**
  Сквозь модель, все экраны, меню и тексты, внутренний и LX-бэкап. Ключ
  хранилища `channels` → `directions` с одноразовой миграцией — данные,
  фильтры, auto-двойники и правила переезжают сами. **Путь Debug API
  `/channels` → `/directions` без алиасов**: скрипты и автоматизацию надо
  поправить, старый путь снят, а не объявлен устаревшим. Теги `vpn-1 … vpn-10`
  остаются валидными обычными тегами.

- **Направления: произвольные теги и состав.** Потолок в 10 Направлений снят,
  тег может быть любым (`ru-exit` вместо очередного `vpn-N`) с проверкой на
  дубли, служебные имена и коллизии с auto-двойником. Направление может
  включать `direct-out`, `block` и другие Направления через `include[]`. Форма
  перегруппирована; смена префикса подписки каскадом доезжает до ссылок.

- **Правки источников применяются к живому туннелю.** In-place reload вместо
  баннера «перезапустите VPN».

- **Санитайзер графа.** Битый элемент деградирует с предупреждением, а не
  отказом всего конфига; пустое Направление блокирует трафик, а не течёт
  мимо VPN.

- **WARP: `vhttp: auto`** (h3 с откатом на h2) в визарде MASQUE, дефолт для
  новых узлов — за TCP-only-хопом туннель спасается в h2 вместо зависания до
  дедлайна.

- **Шаблоны:** load-валидация `#enable` и всех секций.

- **Теги внутри пресетов получили неймспейс `<пресет>:<тег>`.** Раньше два
  пресета с одинаковым локальным именем сервера (`dns-ru`, `geoip`)
  сталкивались, и побеждал первый — второй молча терял свой DNS-сервер.
  Предупреждение о столкновении при этом ничего не давало: теги задаёт автор
  шаблона, а не пользователь. Ссылки в уже сохранённых настройках переезжают
  на новые теги автоматически при первой же сборке конфига. Неоднозначные
  (когда два пресета объявили одинаковое имя) не угадываются — такая ссылка
  снимается штатной деградацией, как и любая другая битая.

- **`vpn://`-ссылка Amnezia больше не теряется из-за размера.** Профиль с
  сертификатами штатно перерастает общий потолок длины ссылки, и такая
  ссылка молча пропадала, хотя десктоп её принимал. Теперь у неё свой
  потолок — 512 КиБ, общий с лаунчером.

- **Ядро обновлено до `v1.14.0-lx.28-rc.1`** (было `v1.14.0-lx.27-rc.2`).
  Тип outbound'а `chain`, варны `tunnel died`, `vhttp=auto` у MASQUE. В том же
  цикле (lx.27-rc.4) добит фриз detour (SPEC 072): провал поднятия
  XHTTP-стрима рвёт upload-пайп с читающей половины, а запросы всех трёх
  режимов ездят на conn-scoped контексте — 15-секундный дедлайн дайла больше
  не рвёт живой стрим. Полевой симптом, который это чинит: весь трафик мёртв
  (включая direct), пинг-тест при этом проходит, лечит только force-stop.

### Fixed

- **XHTTP-узлы из JSON-подписок собирались с урезанным транспортом ([§399](docs/spec/tasks/399-xhttp-fields-lost-in-json-branches.md)).**
  Расширенные поля XHTTP (`uplink_http_method`, `x_padding_bytes`, sc-параметры,
  placement/key-поля) читались только из ссылок `vless://…?type=xhttp`. Подписка,
  отдающая готовый Xray-конфиг, теряла их все: из `xhttpSettings` читались лишь
  `path`, `host` и `mode`. Сервер отвергал HTTP-запрос XHTTP-слоя, узел не
  работал при живом TLS-рукопожатии — например, когда сервер ждёт uplink методом
  `GET`, а ядро без этого поля шлёт `POST`.

  Та же дыра была в разборе sing-box-JSON: узел с полным набором полей после
  открытия и сохранения в JSON-редакторе молча терял их.

  Теперь состав полей общий для всех трёх веток разбора. Читается и вложенный
  объект `extra`, и плоская раскладка (при конфликте выигрывает `extra`) —
  битый `extra` по-прежнему не роняет узел, тот просто собирается без этих полей.

---

## [2.20.12] — 2026-08-18

Обмен правилами после полевой проверки: пресеты в нём больше не участвуют,
дубли не создаются, DNS можно выгрузить отдельно.

### Fixed

- **Пресет «Обработка трафика» задваивался при импорте и не удалялся (§398).**
  Экспорт позволял вложить пресет в файл, а импорт — добавить вторую копию.
  Удалить её было невозможно: инвариант §264 проверяет наличие пресета по
  `presetId` и при двух копиях молчал, а удаление обеих тут же пересоздавало
  одну.

  Теперь пресеты вне обмена целиком — ни экспорта, ни импорта: они есть у
  каждого получателя, потому что приходят из шаблона приложения. Уже
  задвоенный список чинится сам при первом открытии экрана «Маршрутизация» —
  остаётся последний экземпляр, тот, что приехал из файла.

### Changed

- **Дубли по имени больше не создаются (§398).** Правило с уже занятым
  видимым именем помечается в превью импорта как «Уже есть на этом
  устройстве» и не добавляется. Суффиксы « (2)» убраны: два правила с
  неотличимыми именами невозможно осмысленно разбирать и удалять.
- **Экспорт только DNS (§398).** Кнопка «Продолжить» на первом шаге доступна
  и без выбранных правил — можно перейти к шагу «Добавить DNS» и выгрузить
  одни DNS-серверы с DNS-правилами. Пустой файл при этом не создаётся.

---

## [2.20.11] — 2026-08-17

Правила роутинга теперь переносятся между устройствами файлом — вместе с
DNS-серверами, от которых зависят. Ядро обновлено до `lx.27-rc.2`.

### Added

- **Экспорт и импорт правил роутинга файлом (§396).** В шапке экрана
  Routing на вкладке Rules появилось меню ⋮: «Export rules...» открывает
  полноэкранный выбор правил (с кнопкой «Выбрать все») и сохраняет их одним
  JSON-файлом через знакомый по бэкапу шит — «Сохранить в файл» /
  «В Загрузки» / «Поделиться»; «Import
  rules...» читает такой файл, показывает превью с галочками и добавляет
  выбранные правила к существующим. При импорте ссылки на чужие сущности
  лечатся: несуществующий канал заменяется на `vpn-1` (правило приезжает
  выключенным, причина видна в превью), пропавший DNS-сервер выключает
  DNS-опцию (Force IPv4 переживает), srs-правила приезжают выключенными до
  загрузки `.srs` через ☁. Повторный импорт того же файла создаёт копии
  (« (2)» в имени), а не конфликтует.

  Второй шаг экспорта — **«Добавить DNS»**: правило вроде «Gemini через
  свой DNS» бесполезно без самого сервера, поэтому в тот же файл можно
  вложить DNS-серверы и DNS-правила. Серверы, на которые ссылаются
  выбранные правила и которых нет в шаблоне приложения, отмечаются
  сразу. При импорте они показываются отдельными секциями превью; то, что
  у получателя уже есть, помечено «Уже есть на этом устройстве» и его
  настройки не перезаписывает.

- **Тела OOM-снимков в диагностическом дампе (§397).** Раньше дамп нёс по
  OOM-снимку только сводку из семи полей — по ней было видно, что память
  ушла мимо Go-кучи, но не куда именно; за подробностями приходилось
  просить пользователя выгружать каждый снимок вручную. Теперь у пяти
  свежайших снимков в дамп попадает всё содержимое: `metadata.json`,
  `connections.json`, `configuration.json`, хвост `go.log` до 64 КБ и
  pprof-профили (gzip + base64). Одной выгрузки хватает, чтобы открыть
  heap-профиль в `go tool pprof` и назвать виновника по имени.

### Changed

- **Ядро `v1.14.0-lx.27-rc.1` → `v1.14.0-lx.27-rc.2`.** Хотфиксы SPEC 070/071
  (мёртвый detour-узел больше не замораживает сетевую машинерию), синхронизация
  с апстримом beta.15, Go 1.26.6. Первый бамп линейки lx.2x, не нейтральный к
  Java-API: `PlatformInterface` получил абстрактный `cancelNotification` —
  реализован парно к `sendNotification` (`nm.cancel(typeID)` по тому же id),
  дефолт-заглушка в `PlatformInterfaceWrapper` закрывает probe-сессию. Прочие
  изменения ядра чисто аддитивные (Taildrop-биндинги, `NetworkInterface.gateway`):
  javap-обход 228 прежних классов — ноль удалений.

---

## [2.20.10] — 2026-08-14

Приложение спрашивает про автопроверку обновлений при первом запуске вместо
того, чтобы угадывать канал по установщику.

### Changed

- **Согласие на проверку обновлений вместо угадывания канала (§395).**
  В v2.20.9 фоновая проверка гасилась по `installingPackageName`. Мейнтейнер
  F-Droid в тот же день указал на изъян: *«There are many other F-Droid
  clients. You can add an onboarding screen for the update checker.»* Гейт знал
  три пакета — официальный клиент, F-Droid Basic и Droid-ify, — а Neo Store,
  F-Droid Classic, Aurora и всё, что выйдет завтра, проваливались в `github` и
  включали проверку обратно.

  Теперь в цепочку первого запуска добавлен четвёртый шаг: явный вопрос,
  можно ли раз в сутки обращаться к github.com за новыми версиями. Дефолт
  `auto_check_updates` перевёрнут в `false` — до ответа приложение за релизами
  в сеть не ходит вообще, откуда бы ни было установлено. У существующих
  установок значение сохраняется: настройку пишет только этот диалог.

  Канал установки остался подсказкой для дефолтной кнопки — из магазина
  первой стоит «Пропустить», при sideload «Включить». Ошибка в определении
  канала теперь безобидна: решает ответ пользователя.

  Гейт `autoCheckSupported` снят, переключатель «Check for updates on launch»
  снова виден на всех каналах, «Check now» не затрагивался.

---

## [2.20.9] — 2026-08-14

Фоновая проверка обновлений ограничена sideload-сборками — требование
рецензента F-Droid. Плюс пин ядра на `v1.14.0-lx.27-rc.1`.

### Changed

- **Фоновая проверка обновлений — только у сборок с GitHub (§395).**
  Рецензент F-Droid заблокировал [MR!44731](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/44731):
  приложение само ходило в `api.github.com` через 5 секунд после старта, а
  `auto_check_updates` был включён по умолчанию — по правилам каталога это
  anti-feature `Tracking`. В сборках из F-Droid и Google Play автопроверка
  выключена насовсем, переключатель «Check for updates on launch» скрыт, и
  снек из кеша больше не всплывает. Кнопка «Check now» остаётся везде: явное
  нажатие пользователя фоновым опросом не считается, из каталогов же про
  новые версии сообщает клиент магазина.

  Канал определяется в рантайме по `installingPackageName`, а не через
  `--dart-define`: define попал бы в скомпилированный Dart-код, байты
  разошлись бы с APK из GitHub Releases и `binary:`-сверка F-Droid упала бы
  (§390).

### Kernel

- **Пин ядра `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.5` → `v1.14.0-lx.27-rc.1`.** SPEC 069 — фикс
  bind'а WireGuard на Windows: провал v6-сокета больше не закрывает уже
  открытый живой v4. Android правка не затрагивает (изменён только `conn/`
  форка wireguard-go), но пин у сборок общий. Java-API проверен `javap`'ом по
  всем 228 классам — с `lx.25-rc.5` диффа нет, обвязку править не пришлось.

---

## [2.20.8] — 2026-08-12

Ядро `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.3` → `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.5`, MASQUE переведён на новую
схему конфига ядра. Изменения внутренние — поведение и интерфейс прежние.

### Kernel

- **Пин ядра `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.3` → `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.5`.** Схема конфига
  `masque` приведена к стандарту sing-box (SPEC 062): версия HTTP переехала из
  `network` в собственный ключ `vhttp`, TLS-опции — из плоского корня во
  вложенный `tls{}` (`sni` → `tls.server_name`, `skip_cert_verify` →
  `tls.insecure`, `fragment`/`record_fragment`/`fragment_fallback_delay` — под
  `tls`). Прежние имена ядро принимает до `v1.14.0-lx.30`, печатая по одному
  предупреждению на outbound. Новое поле `tls.disable_sni` — ClientHello без
  SNI: пустой `sni` этого не давал, он подменялся дефолтом профиля.
- **Дефолтный SNI у masque сменился** на `www.cloudflare.com` (было
  `consumer-masque.cloudflareclient.com`). Затрагивает только конфиги без явного
  SNI; заданное значение по-прежнему сильнее. Причина — с прежним именем
  h3-туннель не поднимался на российских каналах; для аутентификации имя
  некритично, эндпоинт проверяется пиннингом ECDSA-ключа.
- Диагностика: `masque: CONNECT-IP timed out` вместо простыни про
  `http3: parsing frame failed`, когда эндпоинт принял QUIC, но не ответил на
  CONNECT-IP.

### Changed

- **§393 — MASQUE на новую схему конфига.** Эмит пишет только новые имена
  (`vhttp` + `tls{}`); старые не пишутся никогда — они дают предупреждение на
  каждый outbound, а пара «старое + новое имя с разными значениями» роняет старт
  ядра. Обратная совместимость осталась на входе: URI-парсер и импорт JSON
  принимают и `network`, и `vhttp`, так что сохранённые ссылки и чужие конфиги
  читаются как прежде. Узлы переезжают на новое имя при следующем
  пересохранении.
- **Версия HTTP больше не хранится в кеше WARP-регистрации.** Это свойство
  узла, а не аккаунта: одни и те же ключи порождают и h3-, и h2-узлы, а мастер
  выбирает версию заново при каждом добавлении. Ключ `network` из
  `masque_account` удалён; старые записи не трогаются и игнорируются при чтении.
- **Фрагментация TLS теперь применяется и к MASQUE** — при `vhttp: h2`
  (TCP+TLS). При h3 фрагментировать нечего: QUIC не несёт TLS поверх TCP, и ядро
  такие поля игнорирует, поэтому h3-узлы пропускаются молча.

### Internal

- **§380 — скрипт сверки APK с F-Droid** (`scripts/verify-fdroid-apk.sh`):
  пофайловый SHA-256 внутри zip плюс разбор APK Signing Block. Второе важно
  отдельно — блок лежит вне zip-структуры, пофайловое сравнение его не видит.

---

## [2.20.7] — 2026-08-12

Ядро `v1.14.0-lx.22` → `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.3`, вкладка Diagnostics на экране
узла, массовые действия по результатам теста на подписке и визард WARP.

### Kernel

- **Пин ядра `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.1` → `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.3`.** Две правки, обе про
  TLS-плечо под `detour`. **SPEC 060**: `record_fragment` включается сам, когда
  outbound диалит через `detour`. Симптом — цепочка вида `MASQUE detour VLESS`
  висела ~15 с и падала с `tls handshake: EOF`. Причина не в ядре и не в SNI:
  нижнее плечо пересылает наш ClientHello от своего имени, и если PMTU за этим
  плечом меньше размера ClientHello, пакет теряется молча — ICMP «fragmentation
  needed» до клиента не доходит. Порог чистый по размеру (1488 B проходит,
  1502 B исчезает) и принадлежит пути за плечом, а не протоколу;
  воспроизводится голым `curl`. Точка врезки одна — `NewClientWithOptions`, до
  выбора движка, поэтому STD, uTLS и REALITY получают одинаковый дефолт.
  Затрагивает **любой** outbound с `detour`, не только MASQUE-цепочки; явный
  выбор пользователя сильнее, `fragment: true` не апгрейдится; переписывается
  только первая TLS-запись, прямой путь не затронут. **SPEC 021**: MASQUE на h2
  переехал на общий `common/tls` — был последним outbound'ом мимо общего слоя
  (голый `crypto/tls.Client` ради pinning'а по ECDSA-ключу endpoint'а), теперь
  pinning лежит поверх общего клиента; h3 не тронут. Java-поверхность не
  изменилась — `classes.jar` побайтово равен rc.1.

- **Пин ядра `v1.14.0-lx.24-rc.2` → `v1.14.0-lx.25-rc.1`.** Ядро получило
  `GetURLViaOutbound` (SPEC 058) — диагностический HTTP GET через конкретный
  узел, адресуемый тегом, с возвратом тела ответа. До него единственной
  диагностикой узла было одно число задержки: `URLTestOutbound` отвечает «жив,
  N мс» и тело выбрасывает. Адресация тегом означает, что участника группы
  можно опросить, не переключая активный selector и не обрывая живые
  соединения. Java-поверхность изменилась: добавились `GetURLResult`,
  `HTTPHeaders` и сам метод `CommandClient.getURLViaOutbound`.

### Added

- **§392 — вкладка Diagnostics на экране узла.** Третья вкладка рядом с
  Settings и JSON: выпадающий список предопределённых чекеров
  (`1.1.1.1/cdn-cgi/trace` по IP и по имени хоста, `api.ip2location.io`,
  `ipinfo.io`), кнопка запуска и сырой ответ в поле ниже. Отвечает на вопросы,
  которые пинг не покрывает: какой exit-IP даёт узел, какую страну видят
  сервисы, включён ли WARP на самом деле. Раньше это проверялось только
  переключением на узел и открытием браузера — диагностикой ценой обрыва
  соединений.

  Тело ответа показывается **как есть**, без разбора: приложение не парсит
  формат чужого сервиса, поэтому его изменение не ломает вкладку. Ветка ядра
  выбирается автоматически — при выключенном VPN поднимается временная
  probe-сессия из одного этого узла, при включённом запрос идёт через боевое
  ядро по тегу; через что именно шёл запрос, подписано над ответом. Вкладка не
  отвечает на вопрос «через что я хожу прямо сейчас»: живой маршрут с
  правилами и выбором группы проверяется только обычным запросом с устройства.

  Запрос уходит исключительно по нажатию кнопки — открытие вкладки ничего не
  отправляет. Это требование ядра: проба тратит реальный трафик и будит спящие
  WG-узлы, поэтому фоновые обходы списка запрещены. Адрес выбранного чекера
  виден до запуска — понятно, какому стороннему сервису достанется exit-IP
  узла. Не-2xx (например, 429 от гео-сервиса при исчерпании лимита) считается
  результатом, а не поломкой узла, и показывается со статусом и телом. Узел
  автовыбора не диагностируется — своего соединения у него нет, проверяются
  участники.

- **Рекомендованный MASQUE SNI помечен в визарде WARP.** `consumer-masque` идёт
  в `sni_pool` первым и несёт явный ключ `recommended_sni` из asset'а; пометка
  доезжает до комбобокса визарда, поэтому рабочее значение видно сразу, а не
  подбирается наугад.

### Kernel (lx.24-rc.2)

- **Пин ядра `v1.14.0-lx.24-rc.2`.** Догон upstream (19 новых коммитов на базе
  `v1.14.0-beta.9`) и переезд сборочного тулчейна на go1.26.5 вслед за
  апстримом; кода lx-слоя выпуск не меняет. Из апстрим-хвоста заметное:
  DNS-кеши локального транспорта партиционируются по сигнатуре интерфейса —
  смена сети больше не отдаёт чужой кеш; WireGuard-хендшейк резолвит все
  адреса домен-пира и гонит их наперегонки; hijacked-DNS получил process info;
  фиксы reset network, FakeIP async-save, Android process finder и
  unbounded-аллокаций на злом SRS. Java-поверхность не изменилась —
  `classes.jar` побайтово равен предыдущему пину. Промежуточные `lx.23` и
  `lx.24-rc.1` касаются десктопного демона `lxd` и Android-сборку не
  затрагивают.

### Added

- **§388 — массовые действия по результатам теста на подписке.** У папки и
  подписки один и тот же тест серверов, но действия по его результатам были
  только у папки: на подписке после прогона оставались поштучные тумблеры —
  пропинговал 700 нод, три десятка ошибок выключай пальцем. Теперь в меню `⋮`
  probe-бара подписки есть «Disable slower than…» (диалог порога) и «Disable
  unreachable» (не ответившие, битые и невалидные). Отметки ложатся теми же
  ручными выключениями узлов, что и одиночные тумблеры. «Delete unreachable»
  на подписку не переносится: узлы принадлежат провайдеру, обновление их
  вернёт. Если у подписки есть правило фильтров с действием Enable, оно эти
  отметки на следующем обновлении снимет — предупреждение показывается прямо
  в диалоге.

- **§386 — известные значения endpoint в визарде WARP выбираются из списка.**
  Дефолтный `engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408` у части операторов дропается
  целиком, а кубик 🎲 давал только случайное значение — рабочие адреса руками
  никто не помнит. Поля WG Endpoint и MASQUE Endpoint IP стали комбобоксами:
  свободный ввод плюс выпадающий список известных значений, кубик рядом.

### Changed

- **§391 — переключатель «все узлы» переехал в строку теста серверов.** Раньше
  он жил в блоке метаданных, далеко от прочих действий над списком. Заодно
  исправлена его фаза: иконка выбиралась по будущему действию, а не по
  текущему состоянию, поэтому при всех включённых узлах он выглядел
  выключенным и наоборот.

- **§391/§389 — меню действий по тесту открывается по первому вердикту.**
  Пункты разблокируются, как только хотя бы один узел отдал результат, а не
  после конца прогона.

- **§389 — кнопка `⋮` в строке теста всегда на месте.** Раньше она появлялась
  только при готовых результатах: контрол то возникал, то исчезал, соседние
  кнопки разъезжались, а до первого теста меню было не найти вовсе. Теперь
  кнопка видна всегда, а готовность результатов гейтит доступность пунктов.

- **§390 — уведомление о новой версии ведёт в тот магазин, откуда приложение
  установлено.** Один и тот же код уезжает в три канала, и у каждого своя
  подпись: APK с GitHub не встаёт поверх сборки из Google Play или F-Droid
  («signatures do not match»). Прежняя кнопка вела на GitHub всегда — то есть
  для двух каналов из трёх в тупик. Теперь приложение определяет канал
  установки (build-time флаг, иначе — по установщику) и ведёт в Play, F-Droid
  или на страницу релиза соответственно. Канал показан в About, строкой под
  версией.

- **§390 — уведомление больше не выскакивает поверх работающего приложения.**
  Показ был из двух источников: кеш при старте и результат сетевой проверки
  посреди сессии. Второй убран — новость из проверки ложится в кеш и
  показывается при следующем запуске. Снек живёт 6 секунд, смахивается, и
  показывается не чаще раза за запуск.

- **§390 — у уведомления две кнопки вместо одной.** «Later» — напомнить при
  следующем запуске, «Ignore» — не напоминать про эту версию совсем (про
  следующую напомним). Клик по самому уведомлению ведёт в магазин и работает
  как «Later».

### Fixed

- **§387 — приложение зависало в «Подключено» после неудачного старта.** Под
  «белыми списками» мобильного интернета старт узла с доменным адресом мог
  зависнуть в ядре дольше, чем пятнадцатисекундный таймаут обвязки. Обвязка
  успевала аварийно остановиться, а зависший старт доезжал секундами позже и
  объявлял «запущено» — приложение показывало подключение к уже мёртвой
  сессии, останавливаться и запускаться заново отказывалось. Теперь поздний
  ответ сверяется с текущим состоянием: если сессию уже остановили, он
  игнорируется, а успевшее подняться ядро добивается.

- **§386 — пометка «рекомендуется» у пресетов WARP не зависит от порядка
  списка.** Помечается пункт, совпадающий с явным значением из набора данных,
  на любой позиции; нет значения — нет пометки.

- **§386 — длинные подписи пресетов больше не переносятся на вторую строку**,
  а в списке MASQUE первым идёт домен.

- **Кнопка перезагрузки на главном экране не уезжала за край** при длинной
  надписи статуса.

- Открытие ссылок с нестандартной схемой (`market://`) на устройствах без
  Google Play больше не роняет переход: подставляется обычная https-форма.

### Store

- Тексты витрины и графика 1024×500 подготовлены под Google Play; добавлена
  политика конфиденциальности. CI умеет собирать AAB.

## [2.20.6] — 2026-08-07

Релиз целиком про ядро: пин `v1.14.0-lx.21` → `v1.14.0-lx.22`. Кода приложения
не касается. Java-поверхность AAR не изменилась — 226 классов в обеих версиях,
`javap`-diff всех сигнатур 0 строк расхождений (проверка §178-181 перед бампом).

### Changed

- **SPEC 054 (ядро) — группа с автовыбором оставалась на переставшем работать
  узле.** Группы в режиме `urltest` брали узел из последней проверки здоровья и
  пересматривали выбор только в конце следующего планового прогона — до трёх
  минут спустя, а с `passive_check` и дольше. Неудачное боевое соединение не
  меняло ничего: реакции на отказ дайла у `least_test` не было ни в форке, ни в
  апстриме, потому что причина отказа неоднозначна (мёртвый узел против мёртвого
  сайта против моргнувшей локальной сети). Итог после SPEC 052 (v2.20.5): вместо
  двухминутного зависания пользователь получал ошибку каждые 15 секунд, но всё
  через тот же мёртвый узел.

  Теперь отказ класса «путь мёртв» — таймаут дайла, `EHOSTUNREACH` /
  `ENETUNREACH` / `ETIMEDOUT` — даёт узлу **+1 штраф** и один запасной дайл
  через лучшего кандидата. Кап — две попытки на пользовательский дайл; успех
  запасного переносит на него выбор группы **без** разрыва живых соединений.
  `ECONNREFUSED` / `ECONNRESET` штрафа не дают и фолбэк не запускают: узел донёс
  пакет, отказало назначение — через другой узел будет тот же отказ. Отмена
  вызывающим (`context.Canceled`) тоже не считается.

  При **3 штрафах** у лучшего-по-скорости группа переходит в аварийный режим:
  ранжирование двухуровневое — сначала по штрафам, затем по задержке среди
  равных. Штраф обнуляется только доказательством жизни (успешный боевой дайл
  или ответ на пробу), сбросов по времени нет. Если штрафы набрали все кандидаты
  — принудительный прогон проб не чаще раза в 2 минуты, отсчёт от конца прошлого
  прогона; на время аварийного режима отключается пропуск проб по
  `passive_check`. Новых таймеров не заведено — все проверки суть дельты по
  метке времени в момент события, что переживает и сон устройства, и заморозку
  процесса. `round_robin` не затронут (у пула своя машинерия здоровья).
  Полевого прогона не было: шесть юнит-тестов и стенд.
- **SPEC 053 (ядро) — REALITY-узлы отвергались обновлёнными серверами Xray.**
  Xray v26.7.11 стал по умолчанию требовать минимальную версию клиента
  (`minClientVer`), а ядро всё ещё объявляло версию 2023 года — ниже нового
  порога. Отказ невидим по задумке: вместо отказа сервер тихо отдаёт свой
  камуфляжный сайт, поэтому узел выглядит сломанным при чистом логе и неотличим
  от неверного ключа или разъехавшихся часов. Объявляемая версия поднята до
  требуемого минимума (26.3.27); на старые серверы это не влияет. Сверено с
  исходниками XTLS построчно, против живого сервера ≥ v26.7.11 не проверялось —
  стенда нет.

## [2.20.5] — 2026-08-06

Два исправления по репортам пользователя со старого Android (7.1.1) плюс бамп
ядра `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.8` → `v1.14.0-lx.21`.

### Fixed

- **§383 — импорт файла не работал при установленном файловом менеджере.**
  Проверка «есть ли на устройстве пикер» спрашивала систему только про
  `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` — это Storage Access Framework, и отвечают на него
  приложения-провайдеры документов. Файловые менеджеры старой школы (Total
  Commander и аналоги, массовые на 7.x) регистрируются на `ACTION_GET_CONTENT`
  и на первый запрос не отзываются. Итог: приложение сообщало «нет файлового
  менеджера» при рабочем менеджере в системе, и импорт из файла был закрыт
  наглухо. Теперь опрашиваются оба варианта, и если доступен только
  `GET_CONTENT` — выбор идёт через него. Приоритет остаётся за
  `OPEN_DOCUMENT`. Плагин `file_picker` переключаться между ними не умеет
  (для произвольного типа файла он жёстко строит `OPEN_DOCUMENT`), поэтому
  второй путь реализован своим кодом.
- **§385 — на старых Android не подключались узлы с настоящим TLS.** Набор
  корневых сертификатов вшит в прошивку и на 7.1.1 не обновлялся с 2016 года:
  в нём нет Let's Encrypt (корень ISRG Root X1), а кросс-подпись через DST
  Root CA X3 истекла 30.09.2021. Проверка цепочки не проходила, и работали
  только узлы с отключённой проверкой. В настройках VPN → Core появился выбор
  **Certificate store**: `system` (как раньше), `mozilla`, `chrome`. Наборы
  Mozilla и Chrome уже вкомпилированы в ядро — ничего не скачивается, размер
  приложения не растёт. Настройка глобальная: чинит все узлы разом.

### Changed

- **Ядро `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.8` → `v1.14.0-lx.21`.** Java-поверхность AAR не
  изменилась — клиентских правок бамп не потребовал.
- **SPEC 052 (ядро) — соединения через мёртвый путь висели две минуты в
  тишине.** У соединений внутри туннеля (узлы WireGuard и AmneziaWG, MASQUE,
  OpenVPN, OpenConnect, Tailscale) не было своего ограничения по времени: пока
  путь молчал, а не отвечал отказом, попытка соединения ждала около 127 секунд
  до ошибки — и для доменного имени это повторялось на каждом его адресе. Так
  выглядит Wi-Fi, переставший пропускать трафик туннеля, или ушедший из эфира
  узел: приложение выглядит зависшим, а группе узлов не на что реагировать, и
  она продолжает слать трафик в мёртвый узел. Теперь такие соединения сдаются
  за 15 секунд. Ограничение действует только на время установки соединения —
  загрузки и долгие потоки не затронуты; UDP не тронут (у QUIC и DNS свои
  таймеры). Замер на стенде: было 2м07с, стало 15.05с.
- **Стабильное ядро вместо rc.** В v2.20.4 был пришпилен `rc.8`; ветка
  `lx.20` доведена до релиза, и пин переехал на стабильные сборки.

## [2.20.4] — 2026-08-06

Релиз целиком про ядро: пин `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.6` → `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.8`. Кода
приложения не касается. Java-поверхность AAR не изменилась — 226 классов на всех
трёх шагах, `javap`-diff всех сигнатур 0 строк расхождений и на rc.6↔rc.7, и на
rc.7↔rc.8 (проверка §178-181 перед бампом).

### Fixed (ядро)

- **SPEC 047 — краш при смене сети в момент старта туннеля.** Действие «сброс
  сети» пускалось, как только появлялся объект ядра, а туннель к этому моменту
  ещё не собран: части, к которым действие обращается, не существуют. Окно —
  несколько сотен миллисекунд вокруг старта, шире при открытии cache-файла.
  Теперь такие команды ждут поднятия туннеля, до того игнорируются.
- **SPEC 048 — краш всего процесса на соединении с мёртвой нодой.** При уборке
  неудачного TCP-соединения состояние освобождалось раньше формального закрытия;
  пакет, пришедший в зазор, попадал в освобождённое. Вероятность росла ровно
  тогда, когда неудачных соединений много сразу (URL-тесты, реконнект после
  смены сети). Опоздавший пакет игнорируется.
- **SPEC 050 — залипшие проверки нод («утерялся пинг»).** На молчащем сервере
  проверка вставала навсегда и переживала остановку VPN, продолжая держать весь
  стартовый список нод (в присланном дампе — две штуки возрастом 100 и 43 минуты
  на 2806 узлов от уже выгруженной подписки). Группа ждёт все свои проверки
  перед публикацией ⇒ пустая колонка пинга и рост памяти до отстрела приложения;
  лечил только пересбор конфига. Исправлены все три причины: таймауты для
  соединений этого транспорта, отмена доходит до застрявшего рукопожатия,
  остановка группы останавливает её проверки.

### Changed (ядро)

- **SPEC 051 + rc.7 — отставание от upstream закрыто полностью.** 217 коммитов,
  база на `v1.14.0-beta.8`, зависимости на ревизиях, которых ждёт upstream. Из
  заметного: дедлок диспетчера TUN, стабильнее URLTest, гонка в сопоставлении
  DNS-правил, исправления WireGuard, обновлённые gvisor/QUIC. Наблюдатель
  Tailscale заменён на вариант upstream (не блокирует, переживает обрыв шины
  уведомлений). Фичи форка целы: detour-цепочка, поток DNS-запросов, пул
  URLTest, idle-suspend, AWG, все восемь расширенных команд.
- **OpenVPN и OpenConnect** включены в сборку (`openvpn-client`,
  `openconnect`) — приехали из upstream, полевого опыта нет, считать
  непроверенными.

### Build (ядро)

- **SPEC 049 — версия Go-тулчейна в `go.version`.** `go.mod` для этого не
  годится: там language floor 1.24, на котором отказывают все QUIC-протоколы на
  вендорских ядрах. Нужно тем, кто пересобирает ядро из исходников (F-Droid).
- **rc.8 — убраны две ловушки слияния.** Дважды подряд (235 коммитов и 217 в
  rc.7) одинаково ломались одни и те же два файла, и поломка не видна при
  разборе слияния. Причина не в удалениях upstream — этого кода у него нет;
  ломалась форма наших добавок: обе сидели там, где дописывают обе стороны, и
  merge склеивал их в то, чего не писал никто, без конфликта. Лечение
  структурное: интерфейсы idle-suspend вынесены в отдельный файл со своим
  импортом (файл-источник стал побайтово равен upstream), проверка при
  освобождении спящего endpoint'а свёрнута в один вызов (наше отличие — одна
  строка, будущий конфликт будет громким). Поведение не меняется, регрессионные
  тесты проходят.
- Урок rc.5→rc.6 записан в процедуру выпуска ядра: зависимость сверяется
  машинно с ожидаемой ревизией, история берётся целиком, а не выборкой по
  жалобам компилятора (взятые так 3 коммита из 14 дали сочетание, которого у
  upstream не было, и краш туннеля при старте); зависимости приводятся в порядок
  до слияния, а не после.

## [2.20.3] — 2026-08-06

### Build

- **§380 — build-id нативных `.so` отключён.** NDK по умолчанию просит у
  линкера вариант `sha1`
  ([`build/cmake/flags.cmake:72`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/build/cmake/flags.cmake)),
  название которого обещает отпечаток от содержимого. На деле LLD хэширует
  **вход** линковки — объектные файлы и отладочные данные, в `.so` не
  попадающие. Поэтому две сборки одного кода в разных окружениях получают
  разный идентификатор при побайтово одинаковых библиотеках.

  Замер на `libdartjni.so` (v2.20.1, сборка F-Droid против релизной, arm64):
  файлы различаются **ровно на 20 байт** по смещению `0x2e0` — это сам
  build-id. Таблицы секций, `.text`, `.rodata`, всё прочее идентично.
  Тот же эффект — на `libflutter_zxing.so`.

  Такой идентификатор бесполезен и для отладки: меняется без изменения кода,
  значит по нему не выйти на нужные символы. Хук на подпроекты в
  `app/android/build.gradle.kts` передаёт `--build-id=none` всем, кто
  собирает нативный код через CMake — секция убирается целиком (так же
  поступают приложения каталога F-Droid, собранные на ZXing).

  Флаг живёт в проекте, а не в метаданных F-Droid: каталог собирает этот же
  `build.gradle.kts`, поэтому один источник покрывает обе стороны и они не
  разойдутся. Проверено: `llvm-readelf -n` не находит `.note.gnu.build-id`
  ни в `libdartjni.so`, ни в `libflutter_zxing.so`.

## [2.20.2] — 2026-08-05

Пустой релиз: выпущен по ошибке, кода не меняет. APK функционально идентичен
v2.20.1.

### Build

- **§380 — хук build-id добавлен и снят, дефолт NDK уже делал то же самое.**
  При сверке сборки F-Droid с релизной (arm64) расходились 3 файла из 379:
  `libapp.so`, `libdartjni.so`, `libflutter_zxing.so`. У первого причина —
  абсолютный путь `dart_plugin_registrant.dart` внутри Dart-снапшота (лечится
  на стороне рецепта: сборка из того же каталога, что и GitHub Actions —
  приём 78 приложений каталога). У двух других расходилась только секция
  `.note.gnu.build-id`.

  Отсюда был сделан неверный вывод, что линкеру нужно явно задать
  `--build-id=sha1`, и под это выпущен релиз. На деле NDK ставит этот флаг
  **безусловно** для любой CMake-сборки
  ([`build/cmake/flags.cmake:72`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/build/cmake/flags.cmake)) —
  обход старого LLDB в Android Studio. Проверяется по архиву: `libdartjni.so`
  несёт один и тот же build-id в v2.19.7, v2.20.1 и v2.20.2.

  Хук дублировал дефолт, ничего не менял и снят. Расхождение отпечатков идёт
  от **входа** линковки, а не от алгоритма; для `libflutter_zxing.so` вход
  различался из-за `--build-id=none`, который рецепт F-Droid навязывал только
  своей стороне (тоже снят). Причина по `libdartjni.so` остаётся открытой.

## [2.20.1] — 2026-08-05

### Changed

- **§382 — QR-сканер переведён на свободный декодер.** Сканер из v2.20.0
  распознавал коды через ML Kit — проприетарный компонент Google. Публикация
  в F-Droid требует, чтобы вся сборка состояла из свободных компонентов и
  чтобы APK побитово воспроизводился из исходников; предсобранные бинарные
  модели не дают ни того, ни другого. Декодер заменён на ZXing-C++ через
  `flutter_zxing` (MIT, прецедент — 38 приложений в каталоге F-Droid).
  Контракт фичи сохранён целиком: `ScanOutcome`, гейт `hasCamera` (§375 C),
  подключение к `addFromInput` (§375 E) и `UserSource.qr` (§375 F) не
  менялись, вызывающий код не тронут. Flavors не вводятся — один вариант
  сборки для всех каналов. Побочный выигрыш: вклад сканера в APK упал с
  ~5.83 МБ (`libbarhopper_v3.so` + три `.tflite`) до 1.81 МБ
  (`libflutter_zxing.so`).

  Настройки распознавания доведены по фидбэку с устройства — первая сборка
  ощущалась хуже ML Kit («ищет в маленьком кусочке экрана, не сразу
  находит»). Причина была в дефолтах `ReaderWidget`, а не в ZXing:
  `cropPercent` 0.5 → **0.9** (виджет отдаёт декодеру ровно нарисованный
  рамкой квадрат `min(w,h) × cropPercent`, то есть при дефолте — четверть
  площади кадра), `tryHarder` и `tryDownscale` включены (быстрый проход
  сдаётся на блике и наклоне, крупный код с близкого расстояния не берётся
  без второго масштаба), `scanDelay` 1000 → **300 мс** (это пауза *после*
  неудачной попытки, а не такт между кадрами: при дефолте попытка раз в
  секунду, все кадры между ними выбрасываются). Добавлен индикатор попыток —
  кнопки съёмки нет, попытки идут сами, и без обратной связи экран выглядит
  зависшим; точка рядом с подсказкой моргает на каждой неудаче через
  `onScanFailure`.

### Fixed

- **§381 — редактор правила маршрутизации терял позицию правила.** Открытое
  и закрытое без единой правки правило могло переехать на другое место в
  списке, а форма считала себя «грязной» при отсутствии изменений. Причина
  одна на обе жалобы: `snapshot()` пересобирал `CustomRule` без `orderNum` во
  всех четырёх ветках (inline/srs/preset/json), хотя параметр есть у всех и
  ключ `num` сериализуется. У снапшота ключа не было, у сохранённого правила
  был — `isDirty()` всегда видел расхождение, а сохранение записывало правило
  без позиции, после чего список пересортировывал его.

### Core

- **Ядро обновлено до `sing-box-lx v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.6`** (было
  `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.5`). В `rc.5` туннель мог падать при старте — иногда с
  первой попытки, иногда через несколько, из-за чего перезапуск выглядел как
  решение. Причина: при обновлении WireGuard-компонента тот отстал на
  четырнадцать коммитов, а взято было три; среди пропущенных — исправления
  гонок по таймингам и переработка внутренних блокировок. В `rc.6` компонент
  взят целиком, наши изменения (обфускация AmneziaWG, transport padding,
  самовосстановление сокетов) наложены поверх и перепроверены на новой базе.

## [2.20.0] — 2026-08-05

### Changed

- **§379 — versionCode считается из версии, а не из числа коммитов.** Раньше
  код брался как `git rev-list --count` — значение зависело от того, сколько
  раз кто-то закоммитил, а не от того, какая это версия. Из-за этого версию
  нельзя было прочитать из исходников (`pubspec.yaml` в git держал
  placeholder), и автообновление в каталоге F-Droid не работало: их
  `checkupdates` не находил версию, каждый выпуск требовал ручного MR.
  Теперь код выводится из самой версии — `((major × 10000 + minor × 100 +
  patch) × 100 + PRE) × 10 + ABI`, где `PRE` кодирует стадию (`01-49` — rc,
  `50` — релиз, `51-98` — hotfix), а последняя цифра — архитектуру
  (`0` universal, `1` armv7, `2` arm64, `4` x86_64). Для `v2.20.0` arm64 это
  `22000502`. ABI ушёл в младший разряд по требованию рецензента F-Droid:
  при схеме Flutter (`ABI × 1000 + code`) архитектура попадала в старшие
  разряды и список версий в каталоге сортировался вперемешку. Побочный
  эффект — `--split-per-abi` убран, иначе Flutter домножал бы ABI поверх
  нашего числа; вместо одного прогона со сплитом CI собирает по прогону на
  таргет. Формула вынесена в `scripts/version-code.sh` — единственный
  источник для CI и локальных сборок, разойтись им нельзя: разные коды
  ломают установку релиза поверх dev-сборки (§186). Обновления у
  пользователей не затронуты: текущий arm64 несёт 3606, новая схема даёт
  число на четыре порядка больше, монотонность сохраняется.

- **§377 — предупреждение о снятом detour больше не забивает лог.** Когда
  подписка ссылается на выключенный узел-посредник (типовой случай — WARP-пресет,
  который сейчас не собран), приложение снимает битую ссылку и пишет об этом
  предупреждение. Раньше — по строке на каждую ноду: 138 нод давали 138
  одинаковых строк за одну пересборку. В диагностическом дампе пользователя
  таких строк оказалось 276 из 305, и всё остальное из лога вытеснилось.
  Теперь строка одна на каждый недостающий узел: сколько нод его просили,
  имена первых пяти и счётчик остальных.

- **§378 — в диагностическом дампе видно версию приложения и ядра.** В корне
  файла появились `app_version`, `app_build` и `core_version`. Раньше версия
  ядра попадала в дамп только заодно со снимками крашей или OOM — без них
  определить, на какой сборке снят репорт, было нельзя, а версии самого
  приложения в дампе не было никогда.

### Added

- **§375 — импорт по QR-коду с камеры.** Пункт «Scan QR code» в меню ⋮ на
  экране серверов перестал быть заглушкой: открывается камера, распознанный
  код уходит в тот же разбор, что вставка из буфера — с диалогом
  подтверждения, где видно, что именно приехало в коде (QR — недоверенный
  ввод, узел не добавляется молча). Работает и для proxy-ссылок, и для URL
  подписки. На устройствах без камеры (Android TV) пункт в меню не
  показывается: у сканирования нет альтернативы, в отличие от импорта файла
  (§372), где подсказка ведёт к буферу и URL. Узлы, добавленные сканером,
  помечаются источником `qr` — до сих пор это значение существовало в схеме,
  но никогда не присваивалось. APK вырос на 3.8 МБ (ML Kit barcode).

- **§374 — экспорт бэкапа умеет сохранять файл, а не только «поделиться».**
  Кнопка Export теперь спрашивает способ: «Сохранить в файл» открывает
  системный диалог сохранения (SAF), «Сохранить в Загрузки» пишет файл в
  публичную папку напрямую (Android 10+), «Поделиться» — прежнее поведение.
  По жалобе пользователя: раньше экспорт вёл только в share-sheet, и на
  устройствах без файлового менеджера бэкап было некуда сохранить — файл
  оставался во временной папке приложения и вычищался системой. Пункты,
  недоступные на конкретном устройстве, в списке не показываются.

### Fixed

- **§373 — ANR при перезагрузке конфига на работающем туннеле.**
  `BroadcastReceiver.onReceive` исполняется на главном потоке, а обработчик
  `ACTION_RELOAD` звал `serviceReload()` синхронно. Внутри — блокирующий
  `cs.startOrReloadService`, который закрывает старый инстанс ядра и целиком
  поднимает новый (разбор конфига, построение всех outbound'ов, DNS,
  маршрутизация). На подписке в ~700 outbound'ов вызов уходил за пять секунд,
  и Android показывал диалог «Приложение не отвечает». Обработчики,
  доходящие до ядра, переведены на `offloadFromMain`: тело едет в
  `serviceScope` (`Dispatchers.IO`), обёрнутое в `goAsync()` — иначе Android
  считает broadcast обработанным сразу по возврату из `onReceive` и вправе
  понизить приоритет процесса посреди перезагрузки. Тем же путём отправлены
  `ACTION_CLEAR_DNS_CACHE` (§263, внутри та же перезагрузка) и
  `ACTION_RESET_NETWORK` (unary-RPC в ядро). Сам `override fun serviceReload()`
  не тронут: его зовёт ядро с фонового Go-потока, там блокировка легальна
  (§122). На устройстве пока не проверено — воспроизведение требует подписки в
  несколько сотен узлов.

## [2.19.7] — 2026-08-04

Из ядра ушли два краша, роняющих весь процесс: смена сети на старте туннеля
и TCP-коннект до недостижимого узла. Оба пришли из жалоб пользователей с
крашдампами. Плюс первые шаги к поддержке Android TV (§372): приложение
появляется в телевизионном лаунчере, а два места, где оно было нерабочим на
TV, починены — импорт из файла и навигация пультом. Полноценного
телевизионного интерфейса нет — вёрстка по-прежнему рассчитана на телефон,
поддержка остаётся best-effort. Проверено на эмуляторе Android TV; на
реальном телевизоре (Android 7.1.1, откуда пришла жалоба) ещё не
подтверждено.

Ядро: `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.2` → `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.3`. Публичный API libbox не
менялся (javap-diff чистый), клиентских правок бамп не потребовал.

### Added

- **§372 — приложение видно в лаунчере Android TV.** В манифест добавлены
  `uses-feature` для `leanback` и `touchscreen` (обе `required="false"`) и
  категория `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER`. Раньше телевизор не показывал иконку вообще,
  а отсутствие явного `touchscreen required="false"` делало приложение
  формально несовместимым с устройствами без сенсорного экрана. На телефонах
  и планшетах ничего не меняется.

### Fixed

- **§372 — импорт из файла на устройствах без файлового менеджера.** На
  Android TV системного документ-пикера нет, а запрос перехватывает системная
  заглушка: она мигала тостом и молча отменяла выбор, поэтому кнопка «импорт
  из файла» выглядела неработающей. Теперь приложение проверяет наличие
  настоящего файлового менеджера заранее и подсказывает рабочую альтернативу —
  вставку из буфера обмена или добавление по ссылке.
- **§372 — кнопка массового пинга недостижима с пульта.** Была
  `GestureDetector`, у которого нет фокусного узла, — навигация по D-pad
  просто пропускала её. Заменена на `InkWell`; главная кнопка Start/Stop
  получает фокус при открытии экрана.
- **Ядро (SPEC 047) — смена сети на старте туннеля роняла процесс.**
  Переключение WiFi↔LTE ровно в момент запуска туннеля убивало весь процесс
  nil-паникой: ядро гейтило ранние RPC по наличию объекта `Box`, но он
  публикуется в момент создания — поля `NetworkManager` к этому времени ещё
  не присвоены. Приложение регистрирует монитор сети до
  `startOrReloadService` (§087), поэтому попадание в окно было штатным.
  Теперь гейт проверяет статус `ServiceStatus_STARTED`, плюс отдельный
  nil-guard в самом `ResetNetwork`. Клиентских правок не потребовал.
- **Ядро (SPEC 048) — TCP до недостижимого узла ронял процесс.** Соединение,
  не дошедшее до established, убивало весь процесс вместо таймаута:
  неудачное рукопожатие в gvisor зануляло `ep.h` и отпускало мьютекс до
  `ep.Close()`, а пришедший в это окно сегмент разыменовывал nil-хендшейк.

### Changed

- **Пин Flutter читается из репозитория.** Версия вынесена в
  `app/android/flutter.version` — раньше была двумя хардкодами в `ci.yml`.
  Замечание из ревью fdroiddata!44731: сборка должна брать число из нашего
  кода, а не держать копию в метаданных упаковки. Пин Go-тулчейна переехал
  в репозиторий ядра (`go.version` в корне sing-box-lx, SPEC 049) — держать
  две копии нельзя.

## [2.19.6] — 2026-08-04

Упаковка под F-Droid по замечаниям рецензентов. Само приложение не менялось.

### Changed

- **Витрина переехала в корень репозитория** — `fastlane/` вместо `app/fastlane/`.
  F-Droid ищет метаданные только в корне: из `app/` он их не видел и считал,
  что описаний и скриншотов нет.
- **Gradle-обёртка проверяет контрольную сумму** — добавлен
  `distributionSha256Sum`. Без него дистрибутив Gradle скачивался без проверки
  подлинности.

## [2.19.5] — 2026-08-04

Публикация в F-Droid: витрина приложения и фикс порядка правил.

### Fixed

- **§369 — закреплённый пресет остаётся в начале списка правил.** Добавление
  нового правила выдавливало закреплённый пресет из шапки: порядок считался
  до нормализации, и пресет уезжал вниз вместе с обычными правилами.

### Changed

- **F-Droid** — в репозиторий добавлены fastlane-метаданные: описания на двух
  языках, иконка, changelog и восемь скриншотов. F-Droid читает их из коммита
  релиза, поэтому витрина наполняется только с новым тегом.

## [2.19.4] — 2026-08-03

Rule-set'ы перестали устаревать молча, плюс три бага одного сценария:
сменить подписку и увидеть результат. Изменение могло не доехать до конфига,
туннель — залипнуть в «Подключено» с мёртвой кнопкой «Остановить», а новые
узлы — остаться без замеров задержки.

### Added

- **§366 — rule-set'ы обновляются сами, по сроку годности**. Списки блокировок
  и geosite скачивались один раз и дальше лежали неизменными: приложение их не
  перекачивало, ядро в сеть за ними не ходит, а в интерфейсе не было даже
  даты — понять, насколько копия устарела, было нельзя.

  Теперь у каждого правила с rule-set свой срок: в редакторе правила появился
  выбор «Проверять обновления» — никогда, раз в день, раз в неделю (по
  умолчанию), раз в две недели, раз в месяц, раз в полгода, раз в год. У
  готовых пресетов срок задан заранее.

  Проверка идёт через полминуты после запуска приложения и через полминуты
  после подключения VPN, только когда приложение открыто. Если не удалось —
  одна повторная попытка через двадцать секунд, дальше до следующего
  подключения. Удачная проверка успокаивает механику до перезапуска
  приложения. Постоянного фонового таймера нет: будить устройство каждый час
  ради файла, который меняется раз в неделю, дороже для батареи, чем
  оправдано.

  Трафика проверка почти не тратит: у сервера спрашивается, менялся ли файл, и
  на неизменившийся приходит ответ без содержимого.

  Неудачная проверка ничего не ломает — скачанный файл остаётся на месте, а
  правило продолжает работать, даже если списка на сервере больше нет.
  Устаревший рабочий список полезнее выключенного правила.

  В редакторе правила видно время последнего обновления и есть кнопка
  «Обновить сейчас». В списке правил по-прежнему только значок облака: скачано
  или нет.

- **§368 — конфиги sing-box импортируются целиком: узлы, группы, цепочки**
  ([#46](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/46),
  [#27](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/27)). Вставка конфига
  sing-box отвечала «Input is not a subscription URL, proxy link, or outbound
  JSON». Отдельный outbound приложение разбирало давно, а конфиг целиком —
  форму с `log`/`dns`/`inbounds`/`outbounds`/`route` — не опознавало вовсе,
  хотя именно её и вставляют при переходе с sing-box.

  Теперь берутся четыре формы: одиночный outbound, массив outbound'ов, полный
  конфиг и массив конфигов (подписка, где каждый элемент — самостоятельный
  конфиг). Из конфига приезжает транспортный слой:

  | что в конфиге | что приезжает |
  |---|---|
  | `outbounds` / `endpoints` | узлы всех 13 поддерживаемых типов |
  | `urltest` / `selector` | группа автовыбора с её составом и параметрами |
  | `detour` | цепочка узлов, звеном может быть любой тип |
  | `route`, `dns`, `inbounds` | не переносится |

  Маршрутизацию и DNS приложение генерирует само из своих настроек, поэтому
  чужие правила не импортируются — диалог перед добавлением перечисляет, какие
  секции остались за бортом.

  Разбор устроен так же, как разбор конфигов Xray: один и тот же сервер,
  описанный в подписке несколько раз, схлопывается в один узел; имя достаётся
  той записи, где оно осмысленное; неподдержанный тип не исчезает молча, а
  оставляет предупреждение на соседнем узле. Кольцо в цепочках (`A → B → A`)
  разрывается на импорте — конфиг из чужого файла пользователь чинить не может,
  и терять из-за кольца узлы неправильно.

  Вставленный JSON с несколькими узлами теперь становится записью-набором, а не
  записью-сервером: с полным списком узлов, их выключением по одному и
  правилами импорта. Тем же порогом, что и импорт файла: одна нода — сервер,
  несколько — набор. Раньше конфиг на десяток узлов попадал в контейнер «один
  сервер» и подписывался в списке по протоколу первого из них.

  Побочно: массив outbound'ов sing-box в теле подписки раньше давал **ноль
  узлов молча** — распознавание формы работало только для вставки из буфера.
  Теперь форма распознаётся одинаково на всех путях, и предпросмотр показывает
  ровно то, что приедет: раньше он мог обещать «Outbound JSON» там, где импорт
  затем отказывал.

### Fixed

- **§367 — после смены подписки узлы оставались без пинга**. При включённой
  галке автоприменения смена подписки перезапускает туннель и перерисовывает
  список — но задержки у нового набора узлов не появлялись, пока юзер не
  запускал проверку вручную. При обычном запуске VPN пинг стартует сам.

  Автоматический пинг был привязан к моменту подключения. Применение изменений
  идёт без разрыва туннеля, подключение при этом не происходит заново — и
  запускать замеры оказывалось некому. Теперь пинг стартует и после применения
  изменений, с той же задержкой и с уважением к настройке автопроверки узлов
  при запуске.

- **§361 — «Подключено» без подключения и мёртвая кнопка «Остановить»**.
  Если запустить VPN на узле, который не отвечает, и не дождавшись нажать
  «Остановить», приложение могло залипнуть: в шапке «Подключено», таймер идёт,
  трафика нет, список узлов пуст, а кнопка «Остановить» нажимается впустую.
  Выйти можно было только выгрузив приложение из недавних.

  Причина в порядке событий: подключение к неотвечающему узлу удерживает
  внутренний вызов на секунды. Остановка за это время успевала полностью
  свернуть туннель — а следом приходил запоздавший ответ подключения и помечал
  туннель работающим, хотя останавливать уже было нечего. Дальше команда
  «остановить» уходила в пустоту и через 5 секунд отваливалась по таймауту.

  Теперь запоздавший ответ проверяет, не отменили ли запуск, и статус не
  подменяет. Дополнительно сама остановка распознаёт рассинхрон и завершает
  туннель сразу, а не ждёт ответа, которого не будет.

  Там же исправлено ложное окно «Активен другой VPN» при запуске. Если от
  прошлой сессии в системе оставался наш собственный VPN-интерфейс, приложение
  принимало его за чужой и предлагало переключиться само на себя. Теперь
  владелец подключения проверяется явно — вопрос задаётся только когда VPN
  действительно чужой.

- **§360 — включение подписки могло не доехать до конфига**. Юзер включал
  подписку на экране серверов, возвращался на главный — а нового набора нод
  там не было. Галка «пересобрать конфиг и перезапустить» не спасала: она
  срабатывает по отметке «есть незаписанные изменения», а отметка в этом
  случае не ставилась.

  Причина — гонка с пересборкой. Возврат на главный экран сам запускает
  пересборку конфига, и переключение галки попадало в её окно: изменение
  применялось к списку подписок, но пересборка успевала прочитать состав до
  него, а по завершении снимала отметку «есть изменения» — за то изменение,
  которое в собранный конфиг не попало. Новый состав доезжал только со
  следующей случайной правкой.

  Тем же путём терялось и добавление сервера, сделанное во время обновления
  другой подписки. Теперь отметка снимается, только если состав подписок под
  пересборкой не менялся.

## [2.19.3] — 2026-08-03

Ядро: **sing-box-lx `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.2`** (было `v1.14.0-lx.19-rc.3`) — два
релиза ядра подряд. `lx.20-rc.1` целиком про среду сборки: единый пин тулчейна
Go 1.25.x во всех сборочных джобах форка (upstream-паритет, SPEC 044);
Android-AAR при этом едет с 1.26.x вниз на ту же 1.25.x, внутри проверенного
диапазона (обе версии device-verified, порог дефекта вендорских ядер —
«≥ 1.25»). `lx.20-rc.2` — уже фикс кода, SPEC 046 (см. ниже).

Сквозная тема релиза — одна мёртвая нода больше не утаскивает за собой весь
туннель: фикс пакетной петли в ядре (§SPEC 046), ru-DNS группой из трёх
независимых путей (§354) и ⚠-метка на ноде, от которой зависят другие (§355).

Из нового в приложении: лента сообщений от автора на языке интерфейса вместо
одного русскоязычного окна (§356/§357/§362) и готовое правило, которое пускает
мимо VPN только push-уведомления Google, не трогая регион Play (§364).

Остальная клиентская часть — из ревизии кода за два месяца работ (§068→§346):
инспекция суммарного диффа, фиксы найденного, актуализация документации и спек.

### Added

- **§364 — готовое правило «Google-пуши (FCM)»**. Уведомления Telegram, почты и
  прочих приложений приходили с опозданием, пачкой при разблокировке экрана:
  постоянное соединение, по которому Google доставляет пуши, плохо переживает
  засыпание устройства внутри туннеля.

  В списке правил появился пресет, который пускает мимо VPN только этот
  push-трафик — по портам 5228-5230 и по списку адресов Google, отвечающих за
  доставку уведомлений. Остальной Google Play при этом остаётся в туннеле,
  поэтому регион магазина не сбрасывается — в отличие от популярного совета
  вывести из VPN целиком «Сервисы Google Play».

  Правило добавляется выключенным и попадает в конец списка: чтобы оно
  заработало, его нужно поднять выше правил проксирования. Отдельной галкой
  можно сузить его до одного приложения — «Сервисы Google Play»; она выключена
  по умолчанию, потому что отбор по приложению работает только в режиме VPN и
  не действует в режиме прокси.

  Если DNS настроен через туннель, к правилу стоит добавить такое же
  direct-правило в настройках DNS — иначе адреса придут из чужого региона и
  уведомления продолжат молчать. Об этом сказано в описании пресета.

- **§356/§357/§362 — сообщения от автора: лента вместо одного окна, на языке
  интерфейса, во весь экран**. Приложение раз в несколько дней работы показывает
  сообщение от автора: как устроена инструкция, где сообщество, чем помочь
  проекту. Раньше это было одно-единственное окно на русском языке, а кнопка
  «Не показывать» гасила его навсегда — англоязычный пользователь получал
  кириллицу, а сказать что-то новое было нельзя.

  Теперь это очередь сообщений. Каждое приходит на языке интерфейса (русский
  или английский), показывается во весь экран, а не тесной всплывашкой, и ждёт
  своей очереди: следующее появится, только когда VPN наработает положенные
  часы после предыдущего «Прочитал». Обновление приложения отсчёт сдвигает —
  после установки новой версии лента не вываливается разом.

  Кнопка «Прочитал» первые секунды неактивна и отсчитывает время: сообщение
  нельзя смахнуть, не увидев. «Позже» откладывает всю ленту, крестик закрывает
  до следующего запуска, ничего не помечая.

  Кнопки в сообщении теперь умеют вести внутрь приложения — например, сразу
  открыть профайлер трафика или настройки DNS, — предлагать сервер к добавлению
  (ссылка подставляется в поле, добавляет пользователь сам) и отправлять
  ссылку на приложение через системное «Поделиться». Кнопка с незнакомым
  действием на старой версии приложения просто не показывается.

  Счёт времени работы стал честным: раньше он шёл, только пока приложение
  открыто, и у тех, кто включает VPN и убирает приложение из недавних, почти
  не двигался. Теперь недостающее доливается из времени работы туннеля, которое
  ведёт сама служба.

- **§355 — граф detour-зависимостей: предупреждение о мёртвой ноде, через
  которую ходят другие.** Если нода с пингом ERR является detour'ом для
  DNS-серверов или других нод (напрямую или через канал, где она выбрана),
  у её имени появляется ⚠-метка; тап открывает список пострадавших с путём
  зависимости. Для DNS-ветки дополнительно показывается баннер (домены такого
  сервера тихо не резолвятся — симптом инцидента 02.08.2026, ср. фикс ядра
  SPEC 046 в `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.2`). Никакой новой фоновой диагностики: только
  уже имеющиеся замеры пинга и выбор групп; непинганные ноды не тревожат;
  urltest-каналы исключены (самолечатся, §308).

- **§346 — Debug API настраивает подписку целиком: identity, on_update_action,
  import-rules CRUD.** `PATCH /subs/{id}` маппил подмножество полей, и три
  группы персистентных настроек `SubscriptionServers` не имели представления в
  API вообще (тот же класс дефекта, что §073 с `replace_detour_chain`).
  Предметное следствие — HWID: панели с гейтом по идентификатору устройства до
  появления заголовка `x-hwid` отдают узел-заглушку `App not supported` (§310),
  а включить его из API можно было только глобальным
  `subscription_send_hwid`, меняющим фетч ВСЕХ подписок, хотя per-subscription
  override (§289) в модели есть. Теперь: `identity` тристейтом (ключ
  отсутствует = не трогаем, `null` = Default/глобальная, объект = Custom;
  объект — патч поверх слепка, поэтому `{"send_hwid":true,"hwid":"…"}` не
  обнуляет UA и device-meta), `on_update_action` (§323) и
  `import_rules_enabled` (§302) плоскими полями. Правила импорта — под-ресурс
  `/subs/{id}/rules` (GET/POST+`?index=N`/GET-one/PATCH/DELETE/reorder) с
  позиционной адресацией по образцу §238: слать весь набор в PATCH нельзя —
  гонка двух клиентов затирала бы правки, и нет адресации к одному правилу.
  Парс правил строгий (толерантность `fromJson` нужна загрузчику storage, в API
  она превращает опечатку в тихо другое поведение). `serializeSubEntry` отдаёт
  все четыре новых поля — read-путь был неполон симметрично. UI и поведение
  приложения не менялись.

### Changed

- **§354 — ru-домены резолвятся группой из трёх независимых путей.** Пресет
  «Russian domains & IPs» гонял весь ru-DNS через один сервер (`yandex_udp` с
  detour в канал пресета): мёртвая нода в этом канале — и каждый ru-запрос
  висел до таймаута. Теперь домены обслуживает DNS-группа `dns_ru`
  (`mode: fastest`, §312) из трёх членов с непересекающимися путями отказа:
  UDP через канал пресета, DoT через `vpn-1`, DoH напрямую. Мёртвая нода в
  канале убивает только первый — остальные отвечают. Шифрованные DoT/DoH
  можно вести мимо канала без утечки, открытый UDP идёт туда же, куда трафик.
  Выбор одиночного DNS-сервера из пресета убран: любой одиночный сервер
  возвращал единственную точку отказа. Настраиваемыми остались канал трафика
  и адрес UDP-резолвера. Миграции не требуется — прежнее значение перестаёт
  влиять.

### Fixed

- **§363 — «SNI в смешанном регистре» больше не убивает узлы REALITY**. Настройка
  из раздела обхода DPI меняла регистр букв в имени сервера у всех узлов подряд.
  Обычному TLS это не мешает — регистр в имени по стандарту не важен, на чём
  приём и построен. Но у REALITY имя сервера участвует в рукопожатии побайтово:
  сервер сверяет его точным сравнением, и одна изменённая буква рушит
  подключение. Узлы переставали работать молча, без ошибки на экране.

  Симптом был обманчивым: пинг в списке серверов проходил (проверка узла идёт
  своим путём и имя не трогает), а VPN с теми же узлами не поднимался. Со
  стороны выглядело как «подписка сломана», хотя в других приложениях — где
  такой настройки нет — те же узлы работали.

  Теперь узлы REALITY эта настройка обходит стороной; для обычного TLS она
  работает как раньше. Обфусцировать там было и нечего: имя сервера у REALITY
  и так подставное.

- **§359 — узлы автовыбора из подписок больше не игнорируют фильтр**. Поиск по
  имени, чипы протокола, транспорта и источника пропускали мимо себя любой
  служебный узел — под фильтром `🇫🇮` в списке продолжали висеть
  `🇪🇺 Europe | Auto`, `Europe | Game | Auto` и «Блокировка». Приложение
  различало узлы по типу, а не по происхождению: группа автовыбора из подписки
  имеет тот же тип, что и служебные узлы самого приложения.

  Теперь фильтр обходят только узлы-шасси: селектор канала с его двойником
  «Авто», «Напрямую» и «Блокировка» — потерять их из-за фильтра значило бы
  потерять управление каналом. Группы автовыбора из подписок и папок стали
  обычными строками списка: их отбирают и поиск по имени, и чип источника, и
  фильтр по пингу. Протокол у такой группы — `Auto`, транспорт — её режим
  (`Fastest` либо `Pool`), так что в фильтре появились соответствующие чипы.

- **§358 — Hysteria2 с обфускацией `gecko` больше не подключается вхолостую**
  ([#53](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/53)). Ядро знает два типа
  обфускации, приложение записывало в конфиг только `salamander`: у узла с
  `gecko` секция терялась целиком, ядро поднимало обычный QUIC, а сервер такие
  пакеты отбрасывает. Со стороны это выглядело как «подключено, трафика нет»,
  без единого предупреждения. Теперь эмитятся оба типа вместе с параметрами
  размера пакета (`min`/`max`), а ссылки и sing-box JSON эти параметры читают
  и сохраняют.

  Попутно закрыты два случая, которые с рабочим `gecko` роняли бы **весь**
  конфиг, а не одну ноду: неизвестный тип обфускации из кривой подписки и
  обфускация без пароля. Оба отбрасываются при разборе с предупреждением на
  узле — узел остаётся в списке и подключается без обфускации.

- **§348 — пачка фиксов импорта Xray-подписок** (по итогам ревизии кода за
  два месяца). VLESS-узел с цепочкой (dialerProxy) больше не теряет
  постквантовый слой `encryption` (§335). Узлы hysteria-формы и узлы без
  явного порта больше не выпадают молча из пулов автовыбора (§322) —
  ключ идентичности парсера разошёлся с билдерным. Один битый элемент
  подписки (поле не того типа) больше не роняет импорт целиком — пропускается
  ровно он, с предупреждением. Порядок узлов больших подписок (>32 элементов)
  стал стабильным — имя сервера-дубля достаётся первому по файлу, как
  задумано в §342. Страховка §343 теперь отбрасывает и числовой `short_id`.

- **§349 — пачка фиксов сервисного слоя.** Настройка «Auto ping on start»
  переживает restore из бэкапа (была единственным ключом-сиротой allowlist'а
  §221). Обновление выключенной подписки больше не поднимает ложную плашку
  «Settings changed» (актуально с галкой §337 «обновлять выключенные»).
  Одиночный замер пинга записывается в канал, с которого его запустили, а не
  в тот, куда переключились за время замера. Debug API `/folders/{id}/probe`
  при работающем VPN отвечает внятным 409 вместо внутреннего маркера.

- **§350 — ключи-комментарии (`//`) больше не роняют запуск.** Ядро отвергает
  конфиг с неизвестным полем целиком, а `//`-ключ — обычная манера
  комментировать JSON-примеры. Теперь raw-JSON правило роутинга вычищается от
  таких ключей с предупреждением (правило целиком из комментариев
  пропускается), а правило импорта §302 с `//` в пути назначения просто не
  применяется вместо порчи конфига.

- **§351 — узел с именем канала больше не роняет запуск.** Узел подписки с
  меткой `vpn-1` давал в конфиге два блока с одним тегом (узел + селектор
  канала) — ядро отказывалось стартовать. Теперь теги каналов
  зарезервированы, узел-тёзка получает суффикс.

- **§352 — пароль с запятой больше не ломает группу автовыбора.** Член группы
  с запятой в пароле (ss/trojan) выпадал из пула после перезапуска приложения
  — разделитель списка членов конфликтовал с содержимым. Существующие группы
  читаются как раньше, миграция не нужна.

- **§353 — профайлер: честная длительность коротких соединений.** Соединение,
  открывшееся и закрывшееся между тиками опроса, показывало длительность 0 и
  могло получить ложную пометку «RST/blocked». Теперь время открытия и
  закрытия берётся из меток ядра.

### Core / Ядро

- **`v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.2`** (было `v1.14.0-lx.20-rc.1`) — **SPEC 046**:
  hijack'нутые DNS-запросы уехали с пакетного цикла tun-стека. Резолв шёл
  прямо в петле, а вызов резолвера блокирует вызывающего на время дозвона:
  DNS-сервер с detour'ом на чёрнодырную ноду держал петлю весь DNS-таймаут, и
  сквозь туннель не шло НИЧЕГО — другие DNS, ICMP, новые соединения любого
  протокола. Фоновой струйки запросов хватало, чтобы держать туннель
  замороженным почти непрерывно. Теперь обмены идут вне петли, потолок 256
  одновременных. Баг старше этого релиза и жил в обоих tun-стеках.
  Java-поверхность не изменилась (javap-diff rc.1↔rc.2 — 0 расхождений).

## [2.19.2] — 2026-08-02

Ядро: **sing-box-lx `v1.14.0-lx.19-rc.3`** (было `v1.14.0-lx.18`).

### Added

- **§339 — Test servers на экране подписки.** Кнопка теста (как в папках) на
  вкладке Nodes: полоса со сводкой `N ok · N err`, бейджи задержки у строк с
  цветом по порогам шкалы, тап по ошибке показывает её текст. Тестируются и
  выключенные узлы (тест отвечает «жив ли сервер», а не «в конфиге ли он»);
  узлы автовыбора получают нейтральный бейдж «auto» (§336). Работает и для
  одиночных серверов. Тест по-прежнему требует выключенного VPN — при
  активном туннеле предложит остановить.

- **§338 — «Автоперезапуск VPN при смене настроек».** Настройки → Общие,
  блок «Поведение»: галка, после которой приложение само применяет
  любое изменение конфига к работающему туннелю — плашек не остаётся ни синей
  («Настройки изменились»), ни розовой («Перезапустите VPN»). Раньше такая
  автоматика была только у подписки (§323), а правку узла, detour, DNS или
  routing приходилось применять вручную. Off по умолчанию: каждое применение
  рвёт туннель примерно на 3 секунды. Пока галка включена, настройка «При
  обновлении» в подписках скрыта — она перекрыта глобально, но сохранённый
  выбор не теряется и возвращается при выключении галки. Туннель не рвётся
  впустую: если пересобранный конфиг совпал с работающим, применять нечего
  (§324). Всплывающие сообщения при включённой галке больше не просят
  перезапустить VPN, а отчитываются о применении: «Конфиг пересобран: N узлов —
  перезагружаю VPN», а после правки канала лишнее «Перезапустите VPN» не
  показывается вовсе.

- **§337 — «Обновлять выключенные подписки».** Настройки → Подписки: галка,
  снимающая запрет на авто-обновление выключенных подписок. Раньше выключенная
  подписка не обновлялась вовсе, и её список узлов тух — включаешь через месяц и
  получаешь мёртвые адреса. Теперь снапшот можно держать свежим, при этом узлы
  выключенной подписки в конфиг по-прежнему не попадают, а туннель из-за её
  обновления не перезагружается. Off по умолчанию; не отменяет ни «не обновлять
  автоматически» у самой подписки, ни min-retry, ни заморозку после пяти
  фейлов.

- **§345 — verbose core logs: live-тумблер, снимающий фильтр TRACE/DEBUG.**
  Суб-тумблер у плитки «Forward sing-box logs»: при включённом основном
  тумблере снимает фильтр TRACE/DEBUG **на лету**, без перезапуска VPN
  (`@Volatile`-флаг в Kotlin, проверка на каждой строке). Сам фильтр (§043
  volume reduction) правильный — trace-поток на живом трафике это строка на
  пакет, — но был безусловным, и device-верификация по debug-строкам ядра
  была невозможна в принципе: на §340 это стоило нескольких слепых итераций.
  Дефолт не меняется (off); ключ `core_logs_verbose` в `native_prefs`
  (§189 write-through), в бэкап попадает автоматически (§221).

- **§341 — Debug API `/action/quic-knobs`.** Диагностическая ручка: включает и
  выключает offload-механики quic-go (GSO, ECN) прямо на устройстве, без
  пересборки — A/B-проверка занимает два запроса вместо получаса. Нужна была
  для расследования «hysteria2 мёртв на устройстве» (см. Fixed), остаётся для
  будущих полевых диагнозов этого класса. Ручка для разработки, на обычную
  работу приложения не влияет.

### Changed

- **§344 — экран деталей outbound'а знает про режимы `urltest`.** Узел
  автовыбора бывает двух видов, ведущих себя противоположно: `least_test`
  (один быстрейший) и `round_robin` (пул из N узлов, §208). Экран показывал
  оба одинаково — `Type: urltest` — и рисовал единственный «current pick»,
  которого у пула нет по определению (§322 §6.3): строка выходила пустой,
  потому что ядро отдаёт пустой `selected`. Теперь: строка **Mode**
  (Fastest / Load balance) + `Pool` / `Pool tolerance` под балансировщиком;
  **Members** разворачивается в список участников — состав из конфига, а
  галка и задержка у тех, кого ядро реально держит в пуле (`getPool`, §208:
  в конфиге весь состав, в работе только `pool` штук); в **Route** пул стал
  одним звеном с раскрытием в слоты и встал по ходу пакета — телефон →
  группа → пул → интернет. Пустой `selected` больше не течёт в
  `SelectorInfo` и `runtimeChainOf`. Device-verified: round_robin на CPH2411
  (pool 2 из 8), least_test на эмуляторе (`vpn-1-auto`, 3 узла).

- **§340 — узлы WARP/WireGuard оживают сразу после включения экрана.**
  Повторная жалоба 4PDA: «варпы протухают со временем». После сна устройства
  сетевое состояние всех WG/AWG-узлов умирает, и хотя ядро лечит это само,
  первые замеры пинга в течение 5–35 секунд после пробуждения показывали
  ошибку. Теперь включение экрана служит сигналом «устройство проснулось»
  (именно включение, а не разблокировка — приложения лезут в сеть сразу, и
  сигнал должен успеть до первого спроса трафика): ядро проходит по узлам и
  переустанавливает только доказуемо мёртвые сессии, живые не трогает — окно
  ошибок должно сжаться до одного рукопожатия. На устройстве прогнано без
  регрессий; целевой сценарий (сон → пробуждение → пинг с первой попытки)
  воспроизводится по заказу тяжело, полевые замеры приветствуются.

- **§347 — «Поделиться URL» без промежуточного диалога.** Long-press на
  подписке → «Поделиться URL…» теперь сразу открывает системное окно шаринга
  с полным URL. Раньше сначала показывался диалог с выбором «маскированный /
  полный», который читался как бессмысленное сообщение, а маскированный
  вариант (`https://host/***`) получателю всё равно был бесполезен. Для
  подписки из локального файла пункт скрыт — файловой подписке нечем
  делиться.

### Fixed

- **§338 — синяя плашка «Настройки изменились» могла залипнуть при актуальном
  конфиге.** Баг старше этого релиза: экраны DNS/routing/per-app/vpn-mode
  пишут настройки отложенно, и «страховочная» повторная запись при закрытии
  экрана переподнимала флаг изменений уже после того, как быстрая пересборка
  на возврате его погасила. Гонка с exit-анимацией (~300мс) — потому «иногда»:
  медленная пересборка везуче затирала ре-подъём. Побочно флаг воскресал и
  после перезапуска приложения (запись настроек на диск случалась позже записи
  конфига). Раньше лишнюю плашку молча гасили тапом; галка §338 «плашек не
  должно быть вовсе» её высветила. Заодно всплывашка после пересборки
  перестала просить «перезапустите VPN», когда конфиг совпал с работающим и
  применять нечего.

- **Hysteria2, TUIC и MASQUE-h3 не работали на части устройств.** Жалоба 4PDA:
  «hysteria2 не работает в 2.19.0», при этом тот же сервер жив в других
  клиентах на том же телефоне. Воспроизводилось на устройствах с вендорским
  ядром (репро: OnePlus Nord CE 2, Android 15): каждое соединение по этим
  протоколам висело до таймаута, тест пинга вечно показывал `-1`. TCP-протоколы,
  WARP AWG и MASQUE-h2 работали нормально, а эмулятор дефект не воспроизводил —
  поэтому баг долго выглядел средовым у репортёра. Причина оказалась в среде
  сборки ядра: собранное Go 1.24 оно давало этот дефект, тот же исходник на
  Go 1.25 — работает. Приложение и его конфиг-пайплайн были чисты. Исправлено
  сменой тулчейна сборки ядра (`lx.19-rc.2`).

- **Узлы Trojan и VLESS с выключенным TLS роняли тест пинга.** Ядро падало с
  внутренней ошибкой при URL-тесте таких узлов. Исправлено в `lx.19-rc.3`.

- **§343 — одна нода подписки с битым идентификатором REALITY не давала
  запустить VPN.** Полевой краш: старт обрывался с `decode short_id:
  encoding/hex: odd length hex string`, туннель не поднимался вовсе — при том
  что виновата одна нода из сотен. Ядро читает `short_id` как шестнадцатеричное
  число фиксированной длины: нечётное количество символов или больше 16 оно
  отвергает, и вместе с ними — весь конфиг. Приложение такие значения
  пропускало: чистило посторонние символы, но не проверяло длину, а слишком
  длинные молча обрезало — получался формально правильный, но чужой
  идентификатор. Теперь битое значение отбрасывается целиком (пустой
  `short_id` протокол допускает), нода остаётся рабочей, а конфиг живым;
  в предупреждениях сборки видно, какая именно нода была битой. Та же
  страховка добавлена на выходе конфига — для узлов, приходящих в обход
  импорта (сырой JSON, правила подписок).

- **§342 — Xray-подписки приезжали в перетасованном порядке.** Замер на боевой
  подписке из 37 элементов: смещались все 37 позиций, узел
  `🇪🇺 🚀Авто | Лучший сервер` уезжал с первого места в конец, а первой
  оказывалась случайная страна. Между тем порядок в подписке осмыслен — автор
  ставит рекомендуемый узел первым и группирует остальные по регионам, и режим
  сортировки «как в подписке» показывал не его, а результат нашей внутренней
  сортировки. Теперь узлы идут в авторском порядке; имена узлов при этом
  остались прежними (сортировка была нужна им, а не порядку, — эти две задачи
  разведены).

- **§336 — узел автовыбора блокировал Test servers папки и подписки.** Жалобы
  4PDA #1406/#1407: после добавления «автосервера» (§322) тест пинга падал с
  ошибкой при каждой попытке, не проверив ни одной ноды; выключение узла не
  помогало — только удалить или вынести из папки. Причина: в probe-конфиг
  группа уезжала заготовкой urltest с пустым списком членов (состав пула
  дописывает только боевой билдер), и ядро отвергало весь конфиг
  (`missing tags`). Теперь узлы-группы в probe не эмитятся вовсе: свой замер
  группе не нужен (её члены лежат в той же папке и тестируются поштучно),
  строка получает нейтральный бейдж «auto» вместо ошибки. «Disable
  unreachable» такой узел не трогает, сортировка по пингу держит его с
  нетестированными, а не с упавшими.

## [2.19.1] — 2026-08-01

Ядро: **sing-box-lx `v1.14.0-lx.18`** (было `v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.5`).

### Fixed

- **§335 — VLESS-узлы с постквантовым шифрованием не подключались.** Провайдер
  включает слой шифрования внутри самого VLESS (`mlkem768x25519plus` —
  ML-KEM-768 + X25519); он работает вместо TLS, поэтому такие узлы приезжают с
  `security=none`. Приложение теряло поле `encryption` при импорте: до конфига
  оно не доезжало, ядро шло голым VLESS к серверу, ждущему слой шифрования, —
  соединение молча не вставало, в логах пусто. Теперь поле переносится как
  есть из ссылок `vless://` (query-параметр) и из Xray-JSON
  (`users[0].encryption` → плоское поле рядом с `uuid`), эмитится только
  непустым и не равным `none` — конфиг узлов без него не меняется ни на байт.
  Замер: 12 настоящих узлов с полем ожили, по всем транспортам сразу (ws, grpc,
  raw tcp). Требует ядро `v1.14.0-lx.18`+ — старое отвергает поле и не грузит
  конфиг целиком.

- **XHTTP-узлы из подписок не проходили тест пинга — ни один.** Жалоба 4PDA:
  подписка из 75 узлов в другом клиенте проходит пинг на 67, здесь — на 36.
  Замер на той же подписке: 30 из 76, при этом падали все 14 XHTTP-узлов, а
  gRPC на тех же серверах отвечал за 78–163 мс. Ядро сообщало
  `v2ray-xhttp: unexpected status: 404 Not Found`. Причина в ядре (исправлено
  в `lx.17`): в режиме `stream-one` обрезался завершающий слэш в пути, тогда
  как сервер принимает только запросы с нормализованным префиксом
  (`/api/v1/feed` против `/api/v1/feed/`). Затронут именно `stream-one` — в
  него разворачивается `mode: auto` на REALITY-серверах, самая частая форма в
  подписках. После обновления ядра на тех же 76 узлах — 42 вместо 30, все 12
  вернувшихся XHTTP. Узлы без TLS (18) и Hysteria2 (11) на этой подписке
  по-прежнему не проходят пинг — отдельные причины, здесь не затронуты.

- **§334 — приложение само чинится после падения ядра.** Жалоба 4PDA
  (evgeny1503): после обновления на 2.19 сервис перестал запускаться вовсе —
  вылет сразу по нажатию «старт», и так каждый раз. Причина не в настройках:
  повредился служебный файл кэша ядра (`cache.db` — подобранные FakeIP-адреса,
  DNS-кэш, результаты пингов, выбор узла в селекторах), а ядро читает его на
  старте до всего остального и падает. Выхода из этого у пользователя не было:
  файл сам не чинится, а кнопка его удаления спрятана в настройках DNS и с
  крашем никак не связана. Теперь приложение при запуске видит, что прошлый раз
  закончился падением, и сбрасывает кэши ядра до старта — второй запуск проходит
  уже нормально. Конфиги, подписки, настройки и списки приложений не трогаются.

## [2.19.0] — 2026-07-31

Ядро: **sing-box-lx `v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.5`**.

### Added

- **§332 — правила подписки научились включать узлы, а не только выключать.**
  Раньше смена критерия в DISABLE-правиле (был фильтр «FI», стал «NL»)
  оставляла старые отключения навсегда: выключенными оказывались и FI, и NL,
  а включить обратно было нечем. Теперь у правила есть третье действие —
  «Enable»: оно снимает отметку выключения, в том числе поставленную вручную.
  Правила применяются по порядку, последнее сработавшее побеждает — Enable-«всё»
  первым в списке сбрасывает прошлые отключения перед новыми фильтрами, а
  связка «выключить всё → включить NL» работает как белый список. Плюс на
  вкладке Nodes появилась кнопка «Включить все / Выключить все» — быстрый
  ручной выход из любого накопившегося состояния.
- **§322 — узел автовыбора в списке серверов.** Провайдеры кладут в подписку
  пул с автовыбором (Liberty: «🇪🇺 Авто | Лучший сервер ⚡⚡» — 15 серверов
  внутри одного пункта). Раньше он приезжал 15 отдельными строками, а логика
  выбора терялась. Теперь это **один узел**, внутри которого `urltest`: в
  строке видно режим и состав — `🔀 [15/7] 🇩🇪, 🇳🇱[2], 🇫🇮` (пул из 15,
  в работе 7, флаги — те узлы, что ядро реально держит) или `🎯 [3]` для
  режима «один быстрейший». Флаги настраиваются regex'ом в редакторе.
- **§322 — свой узел автовыбора в папке.** Меню папки → «Add auto node…».
  Три режима членства: все серверы папки, правило (include/exclude regex с
  живым превью «12 of 37») или явный список галочками. Параметры urltest —
  интервал, режим, размер пула, липкость сессии — в разделе Advanced.
- **§323 — подписка сама решает, что делать после автообновления.** Новая
  настройка «При обновлении» на экране подписки: *Пересобрать конфиг* (по
  умолчанию, как было — применяет пользователь), *Пересобрать и перезагрузить
  ядро* (применяется сразу, соединение обрывается на несколько секунд) или
  *Ничего не делать* (узлы обновляются только в списке). Действует лишь на
  автообновление; ручное ⟳ по-прежнему оставляет решение за пользователем.
- **§321 — Xray-подписки: все протоколы, а не только VLESS.** Элемент
  массива мог содержать trojan, vmess, shadowsocks, hysteria2 — такие узлы
  отбрасывались молча, вместе со всем элементом. У Liberty так терялись три
  платных GAMING-сервера.
- **§321 — дедупликация узлов подписки.** Один сервер, перечисленный в
  нескольких пунктах, становится одним узлом (ключ: протокол + адрес + порт +
  учётные данные). На Liberty 64 записи сворачиваются в 43 узла.

### Changed

- **§331 — «При обновлении» теперь действует и на кнопку ⟳.** Раньше настройка
  срабатывала только когда подписка обновлялась сама, по таймеру: выбранный режим
  «Пересобрать и перезагрузить» на ручном обновлении молча ничего не делал.
  Настройка называется «При обновлении», а не «При автообновлении» — теперь так и
  работает. На ручном обновлении реакция срабатывает только если состав узлов
  действительно изменился: жать «обновить» на неизменившейся подписке больше не
  значит оборвать соединение на несколько секунд.

### Fixed

- **§333 — редактор конфига больше не вешает и не роняет приложение на больших
  списках.** Жалоба 4PDA (k-dmitriy): при ~1000 нод каждый введённый символ
  давал 100% CPU, затем приложение убивала система — с пустым краш-репортом.
  Причина: весь конфиг лежал в одном текстовом поле, которое на каждое нажатие
  пере-размечало сотни килобайт и целиком синхронизировало их с клавиатурой.
  Теперь редактор построчный (re_editor): размечаются только видимые строки,
  в клавиатуру уходит только строка с курсором; бонусом — номера строк.
  Разбор/форматирование JSON5 ушли в фоновый поток (открытие экрана, Save,
  сравнение конфигов при обновлении подписки больше не фризят UI). Конфиги
  свыше 1 МБ открываются read-only с подсказкой «Share → внешний редактор →
  Load from file». Та же построчная схема — во вкладке Source подписки,
  просмотре краш- и OOM-репортов (тело на сотни КБ больше не собирается в
  один блок); у репортов появилась кнопка «Копировать». Поля вставки в
  визарде добавления сервера тоже переведены на построчный редактор.
  Попутно: ошибка синтаксиса JSON5 при Save теперь показывается с
  координатами (раньше терялась), загрузка файла с кириллицей в комментариях
  больше не превращает её в мусор.

- **§331 — плашка «Настройки изменены» больше не появляется от обновления
  подписки, которое ничего не изменило.** Флаг «есть несохранённые изменения»
  поднимался на любую запись настроек, а обновление подписки пишет их всегда —
  хотя бы отметку времени попытки. Поэтому плашка вылезала и когда подписка
  вернула тот же список узлов, и когда обновление вообще не удалось (провайдер
  недоступен, авиарежим): раз в час, на конфиге, который никто не менял, с
  предложением пересобрать то, чему нечего менять. Теперь сравнивается состав —
  узлы с учётом их порядка и отметки отключённых, — а служебные записи
  (статус попытки, счётчик неудач) флаг не трогают вовсе. Настоящие
  несохранённые правки при этом не теряются, в том числе сделанные ровно в
  момент обновления.

- **§330 — после зависшей остановки порт больше не остаётся занятым.** Когда
  туннель завис на остановке, приложение прибивает его принудительно — и вот
  после этого локальный управляющий порт оставался занят ещё 8–15 секунд, уже
  после того, как на экране написано «отключено». Другая программа его открыть
  не могла, запуск VPN в этом окне падал, помогал повторный старт-стоп. Причина
  в порядке действий: порт освобождался только **после** выключения ядра, а на
  конфигах с большим числом WireGuard-узлов это выключение занимает 10–17
  секунд. Принудительная остановка ждёт его 2 секунды и идёт дальше — то есть до
  освобождения порта дело не доходило вовсе. Теперь порт отдаётся первым, ядро
  выключается после него и в своём темпе. Развязка безопасна: в ядре эти два
  действия не делят между собой ничего. Порог ожидания (§287) не тронут — его
  возврат к прежним 10 секундам вернул бы жалобы на «стоп долго крутится».
- **§328 — при нуле серверов главный экран снова зовёт в Servers.** Подсказка
  «Add a server» показывалась только пока не существует файл конфига. Но конфиг
  создаётся и без единого сервера: достаточно подписки, отдавшей пустой список,
  нажатия Apply в настройках или удаления всех серверов — после этого подсказка
  пропадала навсегда, экран выглядел «рабочим», и VPN даже запускался, хотя
  подключаться не через что. Теперь подсказка привязана к сути: серверов нет —
  на главном полноэкранный гайд со ссылкой в Servers и восстановлением из
  бэкапа, кнопка Start не рисуется. Появился хотя бы один сервер (в том числе
  импортом готового конфига) — экран возвращается к обычному виду. Состояния
  при работающем VPN не тронуты: у них свои сообщения.
- **§326 — в папке результаты теста больше не съезжают при удалении сервера.**
  Замеры внутри папки привязывались к номеру строки, а не к самому серверу.
  Пока список не менялся, всё сходилось; стоило удалить один сервер из
  середины — и все значения ниже него поднимались на строку вверх, показывая
  чужие числа. Заметнее всего это было после теста большой папки от генератора
  WARP, где мёртвые узлы удаляют по одному. Перестановки (перетаскивание,
  сортировка по задержке) такой сдвиг учитывали, а удаление — нет. Теперь замер
  привязан к самому серверу: удаляйте, перетаскивайте и сортируйте в любом
  порядке — числа остаются при своих строках. Правка параметров сервера (порт,
  адрес, ключи) сбрасывает его замер: это уже другой сервер, и старое измерение
  к нему не относится. Два одинаковых сервера в одной папке считаются
  независимо.
- **§325 — тест пинга больше не стирает результаты остальных каналов.** Замеры
  хранились одной общей картой на всё приложение, а массовый тест перебирает
  только узлы выбранного канала: на старте он очищал карту целиком, а заполнял
  лишь свою часть. Пропинговал один канал — в остальных пусто, и так после
  каждого переключения. Теперь каждый канал ведёт **свои** замеры и чужих не
  касается. Разделение нужно не только ради этого: адрес и таймаут проверки
  задаются отдельно для каждого канала, поэтому «180 мс», измеренные разными
  проверками, — разные величины, и складывать их в одно место неверно. Если в
  текущем канале узел ещё не проверяли, показывается последний известный замер
  из другого — со значком `~` («приблизительно») и приглушённым цветом, чтобы
  было видно: число получено другой проверкой. Так список не пустеет после
  переключения и не выдаёт чужой замер за свой. Сортировка по задержке считает
  по тому же числу, что видно в строке.
- **§324 — плашка «перезапустите VPN» теперь сверяется с работающим ядром, а не
  с файлом.** Раньше сравнивались два сохранённых конфига, то есть ответ был на
  вопрос «изменился ли файл». У этого сравнения хватало ложных поводов: провайдер
  переставил узлы местами, сместились суффиксы одинаковых имён, а при включённой
  маскировке SNI каждая пересборка вообще давала другой текст — плашка при таком
  наборе не гасла никогда. Теперь приложение спрашивает ядро: сохранённый конфиг
  и работающий приводятся к одной канонической форме **внутри ядра** (один
  парсер, один сериализатор) и сравниваются уже они. Различия в порядке полей и
  прочем оформлении перестают считаться изменением. Вердикт умеет только убрать
  лишнюю плашку — показать её он не может; если ядро ответить не смогло, плашка
  остаётся, как и прежде. Проверено на устройстве: подписка, вернувшая тот же
  состав, плашку больше не поднимает. Отдельная деталь, без которой сверка не
  работала совсем: ядро само дописывает в работающий конфиг служебную секцию
  (сторож памяти), которой в файле не было, — из-за одной этой строки конфиги
  расходились всегда. Теперь она объявляется сразу при сборке.
- **§324 — обновление подписки при живом туннеле больше не сбрасывает порядок
  списка узлов.** Пересборка конфига сбрасывала кэш сортировки, хотя ядро
  продолжало работать на прежнем наборе: новых узлов в списке всё равно ещё нет.
  Сброс теперь происходит там, где список действительно меняется.
- **§321 — имя пункта подписки больше не достаётся случайному узлу.**
  `remarks` элемента получает ровно одна сущность: группа автовыбора, если
  она есть; иначе — единственный узел. При нескольких узлах все получают
  имя с тегом провайдера. Раньше первый узел брал чистое имя, и в списке
  появлялись два «Лучших сервера» — настоящая группа и обычный сервер с тем
  же именем.

- **§323 — плашка «перезапустите VPN» больше не появляется, если состав узлов
  не изменился.** Флаг ставился по факту «конфиг изменился при живом туннеле»,
  но был sticky: пересборка, давшая конфиг, идентичный работающему, прежнюю
  плашку не гасила. Подписка с интервалом в час, отдающая один и тот же список,
  показывала её каждый час без причины. Теперь совпадение с работающим конфигом
  плашку снимает.
- **§323 — успешный «Reload core» снимает плашку.** Ядро перечитывает конфиг с
  диска, то есть работающий конфиг совпадает с сохранённым, — но флаг оставался,
  и плашка висела над уже применённым конфигом. Сбрасывается только при успехе:
  провалившийся reload оставляет ядро на старом конфиге.

## [2.18.2] — 2026-07-30

Ядро: **sing-box-lx `v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.3`** (было `lx.17-rc.1`).

### Fixed

- **§319 — DNS-группа с каналом, отличным от «direct», ломала старт туннеля.**
  У группы нет своего транспорта: в сеть ходят её участники, каждый со своим
  `detour`. В `GroupDNSServerOptions` ядра поля `detour` нет, а sing-box падает
  на неизвестном поле — конфиг не стартовал вовсе. Форма редактора при этом
  рисовала пикер «Outbound (detour)» для любого inline-сервера, не отличая
  группу; «direct» работал лишь потому, что этот ключ и так стирается как
  дефолт. Пикер для групп скрыт, ключ вычищается на сборке — включая уже
  сохранённые конфиги.
- **§320 — early data в форме `?ed=&eh=` терялась при импорте.** §303 научил
  парсер читать early data только из хвоста пути (`path=/x?ed=2560`), но часть
  генераторов кладёт её плоскими query-параметрами. Ломала подключение потеря
  `eh`: при пустом `early_data_header_name` ядро дописывает данные в путь,
  тогда как сервер ждёт их в заголовке → 404. Хвост пути остаётся в приоритете;
  `eh` без `ed` игнорируется. Читается и из Xray JSON (`wsSettings.ed`/`.eh`).
- **§320 — путь с двойным percent-кодированием давал 404.**
  `path=%2F%252Fassignment` декодировался ровно один раз, и в конфиг уходило
  `/%2Fassignment` вместо `//assignment`. Остаток снимается до срезки хвоста
  `?ed=`. Валидность пути не проверяется — эмодзи, `//` и `@` легальны.

### Reverted

- **§320 — ECH из подписок больше не применяется.** Промежуточная сборка
  включала `ech=` в конфиг; device-верификация показала, что это **убивало
  работавшие узлы**. Форма `ech=<name>+<resolver>` не несёт ключа — это имя
  для DNS HTTPS-запроса, и ключ принадлежит ему, а не серверу узла. Подписки
  указывают там публичные ECH-пробники: DNS отдаёт один и тот же конфиг для
  `ip.gs` и `encryptedsni.com` с `public_name = cloudflare-ech.com`, тогда как
  SNI узла другой. Проверить пригодность до подключения нельзя, fallback на
  обычный TLS в ядре отсутствует. Параметр игнорируется с `EchIgnoredWarning`;
  `echfq` не читается (legacy pq-schemes роняет конфиг).
- **§320 — фильтр ALPN по транспорту откачен.** Срезка `h2`/`h3` для
  ws/httpupgrade строилась на чтении кода ядра, а не на замере; в таких
  ссылках рядом обычно указан `http/1.1`. ALPN идёт в конфиг дословно.

### Changed

- **Ядро → `v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.3`.** Архив отчётов больше не растёт без границ
  (на устройстве накопилось 427 МБ за 19 дней), `Endpoint.Close()` снова
  сообщает об ошибке закрытия tun-устройства, влиты 240 upstream-коммитов.
  Java-API не изменился — сверено `javap`-диффом AAR перед сборкой.

---

## [2.18.1] — 2026-07-27

Ядро: **sing-box-lx `v1.14.0-lx.17-rc.1`** (было `lx.16`).

### Fixed

- **§317 — DNS-группа не сохранялась: «Server address is required».**
  Регрессия v2.18.0: проверка «для формного режима адрес обязателен»
  срабатывала и на группе, у которой адреса нет вовсе (вместо него —
  участники). Поле в форме не показывалось, заполнить его было нечем —
  сохранить группу из UI было нельзя никак, ни новую, ни существующую.
- **Ядро падало при обращении к конфигу работающего экземпляра
  (kernel SPEC 038).** Метод `GetRunningConfig` возвращал строку так, что
  на 64-битном ARM это убивало процесс ядра при каждом вызове — туннель
  падал без шанса на восстановление. Из-за этого фикс «Not found на узле,
  который виден в списке» (§311) в v2.18.0 **фактически не работал**,
  хотя заметки к релизу утверждали обратное. Именно так падало ядро
  26.07 — три отчёта, найденные новым каналом краш-репортов.

### Added

- **§318 — OOM-снимки ядра.** Ядро складывает снимки своего oom-killer'а
  (профили кучи, memstats, лог и конфиг на момент срабатывания) в
  отдельную папку, но приложение о ней не знало: ни показать, ни приложить
  к отчёту, ни почистить. На тест-устройстве накопилось 575 снимков на
  427 МБ. Теперь это вкладка **OOM** на экране Debug: суммарный размер,
  просмотр memstats и лога, отправка снимка целиком, удаление всех. На
  старте остаются 5 свежих. В дамп идут только метаданные — бинарным
  профилям в JSON не место. Для разработки — `GET /files/oom/list` и
  `GET /files/oom?name=&file=`.

---

## [2.18.0] — 2026-07-27

Ядро: **sing-box-lx `v1.14.0-lx.16`** (было `lx.15`).

### Added

- **§312 — DNS-группы: несколько серверов под одним тегом.** Новый тип
  DNS-сервера **Group**: сервера объединяются в группу со стратегией выбора,
  и резолв переживает сбой любого участника. Три режима: **Stable** (держится
  за рабочий, пока тот не сбоит), **Fastest** (гонка, затем липнет к
  победителю), **Parallel** (каждый запрос гонкой). У серверов нет состояний
  «up/down» — есть записи об ошибках и победах с TTL (`Error TTL` /
  `Win TTL`), поэтому «умерший» путь сам возвращается в строй, когда
  оживает. Группу можно поставить и дефолтным сервером, и резолвером, и
  целью DNS-правила. В списке серверов у группы видно текущую цель и
  состояние каждого участника (чистота, ошибки, RTT) при поднятом туннеле.
  Недоступный участник (выключенный сервер, опечатка в теге) не ломает
  конфиг: он выбрасывается при сборке с предупреждением, а при включении
  возвращается на место сам.
- **§314 — Shield DNS: группа из пяти провайдеров по умолчанию.** Свежая
  установка получает готовую группу `dns_shield` — Google, Cloudflare,
  OpenDNS, Quad9 и Yandex одновременно, тремя транспортами (UDP / DoT / DoH)
  и двумя путями (напрямую и через VPN). Она же становится дефолтным
  DNS-сервером и резолвером. Смысл — ни один отказ не выносит резолв
  целиком: ляжет провайдер — работают остальные; зарежут UDP:53 — работают
  DoT/DoH; упадёт туннель — работают прямые пути; заблокируют прямой
  доступ — работают туннельные. Яндекс-участники приезжают из пресета
  «Russian domains & IPs» и тихо выпадают из группы, если пресет выключен.
- **§315 — трасса DNS-группы в профайлере.** В деталях DNS-события видно,
  через какую группу шёл запрос, кто из участников отвечал и с каким
  результатом (`answered` / `timeout` / `servfail` и RTT каждой пробы), был
  ли веер по нескольким серверам и не ушла ли группа в режим выживания
  (когда чистых участников не осталось).
- **§316 — краш-репорты ядра.** Раньше при падении ядра в logcat оставался
  только адрес без символов, а причина терялась: Go пишет трейс в stderr, а
  тот на Android уходит в `/dev/null`. Ядро сохраняет трейс файлом само —
  теперь этот файл доступен. **Debug → вкладка Crashes**:
  список падений с датой-временем, тап отдаёт файл. После падения приложение
  само показывает плашку на главном — один раз на каждый краш. Архив целиком
  уезжает в «Share dump» полем `crash_archive`; хранится 10 последних
  отчётов. Для разработки — `GET /files/crash/list` и
  `GET /files/local?name=CrashReport-lxbox.log` в Debug API.
  Оговорка: канал ловит паники Go — не JNI-abort, нативные segfault'ы и
  kill системой.
- **Раздел Profiling переехал на экран Debug** отдельной вкладкой — рядом с
  логами и падениями. Pprof-слепки это инструмент диагностики, а не
  настройка; среди тумблеров App Settings они были не на месте.
- **§310 — импорт Xray-массивов забирает все узлы.** Конфиг Xray, где в
  одном элементе описано несколько узлов, раньше импортировался частично.

### Fixed

- **§311 — «Not found» на узле, который виден в списке.** При обновлении
  подписки или правке правил обработки конфиг пересобирается сразу, а ядро
  продолжает работать на прежнем до перезапуска. Список узлов приходит из
  ядра, а «инфо по узлу» искалось в новом конфиге — в окне между пересборкой
  и перезапуском теги расходились, и приложение отвечало «Not found» на
  ноду, видимую строкой выше. Теперь данные узла берутся из конфига
  работающего ядра (kernel SPEC 036). Заодно «Copy JSON» перестал молча
  ничего не делать при такой рассинхронизации.
- **§313 — узлы WARP-генератора получают `persistent_keepalive`.** Без него
  соединение молча отваливалось за NAT.
- **§307 — префикс подписки не накапливается в теге.** Узлы, пропатченные
  правилами обработки, при каждом обновлении получали ещё одну копию
  префикса (`L: L: L: Node`).
- **§307 — сворачивание приложения больше не рвёт массовый пинг.**
- **§306 — удаление своего DNS-правила спрашивает подтверждение.**
- **Плашки на главном экране не переводились.** «Settings changed…»,
  «Config changed…» и «Config loading error» показывались по-английски вне
  зависимости от языка приложения — тексты шли мимо словаря.
- **§308 — «Run URLTest» на auto-группе снова тестирует всех членов и
  переключает группу на живой узел.** С миграции §122 вместо группового RPC
  вызывался пер-узловой замер сквозь текущий выбор группы: при мёртвом
  выбранном узле тест просто падал, группа оставалась на мёртвом до
  interval-тика ядра (жалобы «Auto висит на нерабочем сервере, интернета
  нет»). Теперь вызывается штатный групповой URLTest ядра (force-тест всех
  членов + переселект + разрыв зависших соединений); тот же путь используют
  хвост mass-ping и Debug API `POST /action/urltest?group=`. Дополнительно:
  фейл единичного «Ping» узла, выбранного urltest-группой, автоматически
  форсит групповой тест этой группы — группа слезает с мёртвого узла сразу.
  URL/timeout группового теста берутся из конфига группы (`urltest_url`), не
  из ping settings. Root cause —
  `docs/spec/tasks/308-group-urltest-wrong-rpc-no-reselect.md`.

---

## [2.17.0] — 2026-07-24

### Added

- **§302 — правила обработки подписок (Filters)**. У каждой подписки появилась
  вкладка **Filters**: набор правил, которые применяются к её узлам при
  импорте и на каждом обновлении. Правило состоит из условий и действия.
  Условие — это `путь оператор значение`: путь указывает внутрь узла (`tag`,
  `server`, `server_port`, `tls.utls.fingerprint`, `transport.headers.Host`
  и т.д.), оператор — **contains** (по умолчанию), **equals** или **matches**
  (регулярное выражение), плюс галки **Not** (отрицание) и **Case-sensitive**.
  Условий может быть несколько, объединяются по **AND** или **OR**. Если путь
  оставить пустым, поиск идёт по всему узлу сразу — удобно, когда неизвестно,
  в каком поле лежит значение. Действий два: **Disable** прячет подходящие
  узлы из маршрутизации (в списке они видны зачёркнутыми, как ручное
  выключение), **Replace** записывает новое значение по указанному пути — либо
  целиком, либо заменяя только часть текущего значения; в замене доступны
  карманы `$1`, `$2`… из групп захвата regex-условия. Пример: спрятать узлы с
  символом в имени (`tag contains ⚡ → Disable`) или починить нестандартный
  TLS-fingerprint (`tls.utls.fingerprint matches ^hello(chrome)_\d+$ →
  tls.utls.fingerprint = $1`). Правила работают одинаково для всех форматов
  подписки — списков `vless://`/`trojan://`, Xray-JSON, INI/Amnezia — потому
  что применяются к уже разобранному узлу, а не к тексту подписки. Кнопка
  **Apply rules** внизу вкладки перезагружает подписку и показывает итог
  («применено N узлов, выключено M»). В редакторе правила есть вкладка
  **Matches** — прогоняет правило по узлам подписки и показывает, к каким оно
  применится и что именно изменит, ещё до сохранения.

- **§302 — экран разбора узла подписки (Inspect node)**. Короткий тап по узлу
  в списке подписки открывает его разбор с двумя вкладками: **JSON** — как
  узел выглядит после парсинга (то, что уходит в конфиг), и **Source** —
  исходный фрагмент подписки, из которого узел собрался. Для JSON-подписок у
  Source есть переключатель **Compact / Extended**: compact показывает сам
  outbound-объект узла, extended — весь элемент, как его прислал провайдер.

- **§302 — «Decode base64» на вкладке Source**. Многие провайдеры отдают
  подписку одной base64-строкой. Галка **Decode base64** над сырым ответом
  раскрывает тело в читаемый вид — тот же, с которым работает парсер. Галка
  появляется только когда телу есть что раскрывать, и в этом случае включена
  сразу; для обычного текстового/JSON-тела её нет.

- **§304 — Persistent keepalive в ручной регистрации WARP**. В Advanced-секции
  визарда WARP появилось поле **Persistent keepalive (s)** со значением 25 по
  умолчанию — для обычного WireGuard и для AWG. Без него ядро не держит
  NAT-маппинг: при простое узла оператор закрывает UDP-маппинг за 30–120 секунд,
  пинг WARP уходит в ошибку, а соединение отваливается — раньше это лечилось
  только Rebuild + Reconnect. Значение `0` или пустое поле выключает keepalive.
  MASQUE поля не касается — там свой QUIC-keepalive.

- **§305 — MASQUE endpoint: ручной IP:port и отдельное окно эксперимента**.
  В ручной регистрации MASQUE появилось поле **Endpoint IP** (пустое = адрес
  сервера регистрации) и выбор порта из проверенных рабочих — 443, 500, 1701,
  4500, 4443, 8443, 8095. Пул адресов, по которому генератор подбирает эндпоинты, вынесен
  на отдельный экран эксперимента: JSON пула можно править прямо там и вернуть
  к исходному кнопкой **Reset**. IPv6-эндпоинты предлагаются только при
  включённом IPv6 — без маршрута они всё равно мертвы.

### Fixed

- **§305 — генератор MASQUE-эндпоинтов давал почти одни мёртвые узлы по h3**.
  Для h3 (QUIC) адреса подбирались по всему блоку `/24`, тогда как живут они
  лишь на четырёх хостах — попадание было около 1%, из полусотни
  сгенерированных узлов работал один. Списки адресов и портов приведены к
  проверенным на устройстве: h3 берётся из своей секции, h2 — по всему блоку,
  порты расширены до всех семи рабочих. Заодно из пула убраны блоки, которые
  боевой тест признал мёртвыми.

- **§303 — WebSocket-узлы с `?ed=N` в пути не подключались (404)**. Xray-ноды
  массово задают early data хвостом пути (`/api/v2/channel?ed=2560`). Этот
  хвост уезжал в конфиг дословно, ядро запрашивало путь вместе с `?ed=2560`, и
  сервер отвечал 404 — узел выглядел мёртвым. Теперь хвост срезается, а
  значение переносится в параметр early data ядра; это работает для всех путей
  импорта — ссылок, Xray-JSON и sing-box-JSON. Для httpupgrade хвост тоже
  срезается (поля early data в ядре у него нет). При экспорте узла обратно в
  ссылку `?ed=N` возвращается на место.

---

## [2.16.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added

- **§289 — идентичность фетча настраивается для каждой подписки отдельно**.
  У каждой подписки в её настройках (Подписки → подписка → Settings → «Fetch
  identity») появился переключатель Default / Custom. По умолчанию — Default:
  подписка использует глобальную идентичность фетча (User-Agent, HWID
  `x-hwid`, device-заголовки), как раньше. При включении Custom подписка
  получает собственный набор всех этих значений — начально это копия текущих
  глобальных, дальше правится независимо (в том числе своя кнопка Regenerate
  для HWID). В режиме Custom подписка шлёт только свои заголовки и полностью
  игнорирует глобальные — удобно, когда несколько подписок на разных панелях,
  каждая со своим HWID-лимитом или форматом ответа по User-Agent. Выключение
  Custom возвращает подписку на глобальную идентичность (свой набор при этом
  отбрасывается). Глобальный экран идентичности (App Settings → Subscriptions)
  остаётся и работает как значение по умолчанию для Default-подписок.

- **§279 — локализация приложения: русский язык + выбор языка**. App Settings →
  General → «Language»: System default / English / Русский (default — язык
  системы, с fallback на английский). Переведено всё пользовательское
  наполнение: экраны и диалоги, тексты мастера конфигурации
  (названия/подсказки настроек и пресетов), warnings и сообщения об ошибках,
  а также нативные поверхности Android — шторка-уведомление с кнопками
  Stop/Reconnect, Quick Settings-тайл, ярлыки лаунчера, Tasker-активити.
  Переключение применяется мгновенно, без перезапуска приложения и VPN;
  уже показанные ошибки и статусы перерисовываются на новом языке. На
  Android 13+ язык синхронизирован с системной настройкой «Языки приложений»
  (выбор в системных Settings уважается). Технические поверхности (логи,
  Debug API, automation-события) остаются английскими намеренно.

- **§284 — сканер WARP-эндпоинтов**. Новая папка-эксперимент **SCAN WARP**:
  перебирает диапазоны IP и портов Cloudflare WARP и оставляет живые
  эндпоинты. Пинг идёт штатным urltest прямо по IP (без DNS), полностью на
  стороне приложения — ядро не трогается. Кнопка **«Make experiment»**: попап
  с полем количества нод (по умолчанию 20, клампится 1..200) генерирует пул
  WARP-вариантов (WireGuard / AWG / MASQUE h2/h3) в папку, недостижимые узлы
  отключаются автоматически. MASQUE-пул расширен (CIDR `.198`/`.197`/`.192`),
  чтобы эксперимент раскрыл реальные границы блока эндпоинтов на конкретной
  сети.

- **§283 — отключение отдельных узлов подписки**. У каждого узла в подписке
  (вкладка Nodes) — переключатель: ненужный узел можно выключить, не трогая
  саму подписку и её источник. Выбор привязан к устойчивому хешу узла
  (sha256 канонического представления без tag/detour), поэтому переживает
  обновление подписки, перезапуск приложения и переименования у провайдера;
  узлы-дубликаты одного сервера переключаются вместе (by design). Отключённые
  узлы не попадают в конфиг и подсвечены приглушённо. Мусор в списке
  отключённых со временем подчищается автоматически (TTL-GC при успешном
  сетевом обновлении). Переключатель узла переехал в начало строки —
  единообразно с папками.

### Removed

- **§288 — из статистики убрана вкладка «App» (per-app trace)**. Раздельная
  вкладка для трассировки трафика одного выбранного приложения удалена: всё,
  что она давала для разбора трафика конкретного приложения, доступно на
  вкладке «Profiler» через фильтр по приложениям. Статистика теперь показывает
  три вкладки: Stats, Conns, Profiler. Вместе с вкладкой снят весь per-app
  слой профилирования — запись именованных сессий с выбором target-приложения,
  secondary-пакеты (ручная привязка WebView/подпроцессов) и переключатель
  verbose core logs; system-wide Profiler (запись, live-поток по всем
  приложениям, фильтр, агрегация, экспорт) не затронут. В Debug API убраны
  per-app маршруты `/profiler/{start,stop,active,sessions,session/…,stream,
  secondary-packages}`; `/profiler/live*` остаются.

### Fixed

- **§291 — авто-обновление подписок при возврате приложения из фона**. Часовой
  авто-таймер (`AutoUpdater`, триггер `periodic`) тикает только пока жив процесс;
  при свёрнутом приложении с выключенным VPN Android со временем замораживает
  процесс — таймер засыпает, и подписки к вечеру «обновлены 14 часов назад».
  Добавлен шестой триггер `resumed`: возврат приложения из фона
  (`AppLifecycleState.resumed`) тоже проверяет, не пора ли обновить. Не force —
  проходит глобальный тумблер `auto_update_subs` и весь `shouldUpdatePure`-гейт
  (интервал подписки, 15-минутный min-retry, fail-cap), нагрузки на провайдера
  сверх остальных не-manual триггеров нет. Полноценный фоновый фетч при полностью
  выгруженном приложении (WorkManager) остаётся вне скопа.

- **§301 — regex-фильтры узлов регистронезависимы во всех точках**. Один и тот
  же паттерн компилировался с разным учётом регистра: в поиске главного окна —
  без учёта (`caseSensitive: false`), в фильтре канала и в билдере (который
  решает, какие узлы реально попадают в канал в собранном конфиге) — с учётом.
  Пользователь вводил `warp` и получал разное; обход `(?i)warp` в Dart `RegExp`
  не работает. Приведено к поведению главного окна в трёх точках компиляции
  (`channel_edit_screen` превью, `routing_screen` подсчёт узлов, `build_config`
  `nodeFilter`+`defaultFilter`). Переход только расширяет совпадение; паттерн,
  намеренно отсекавший узел регистром, теперь захватит оба варианта.

- **§292 — Debug API отвергает невалидный `proxy_port`/`proxy_protocol`**.
  `PUT /settings/vpn_mode` раньше записывал любое число в `proxy_port` и любую
  строку в `proxy_protocol` — мусор доходил до sing-box inbounds и ронял reload.
  Теперь порт валидируется в диапазоне 1024..65535, протокол — `mixed`/`http`/
  `socks` (тот же инвариант, что в UI). Невалидное значение → 400.

- **§294 — Debug API валидирует форму DNS-серверов и правил**. `PUT
  /settings/dns_options/servers` и `/rules` раньше писали любой JSON verbatim —
  битая форма доходила до генерации конфига. Теперь kind-ref'ы (inline/preset/
  template) проверяются по типизированной модели, как это уже делал `/rules`
  роутинга; невалидная форма → 400. Форма на диске не изменилась (обратная
  совместимость с legacy-снапшотами сохранена).

- **§293 — Debug API отвергает невалидный `tun_apps.mode` / `background_mode`**.
  `PUT /settings/tun_apps` и `/settings/vpn/background_mode` теперь проверяют
  значение по единому валидатору модели (`off|allow|deny` / `never|lazy|always`);
  мусор → 400 вместо тихого fallback.

- **§293 — Debug API `PUT /settings/vpn_mode` теперь корректно зеркалит режим
  в native**. Раньше смена режима на `proxy` через Debug API не обновляла
  native-флаг `has_tun` (это делал только UI-экран) — из-за чего система
  продолжала считать, что VPN-туннель нужен, до следующего перезапуска
  приложения. Теперь оба пути (UI и API) проходят через единый фасад, который
  зеркалит флаг и досоздаёт пароль прокси при необходимости.

- **§290 — automation `SWITCH_NODE` на уже активную ноду больше не рвёт
  соединения**. Раньше команда переключения на ту ноду, что уже активна,
  безусловно делала re-select и — при включённом «Interrupt connections on
  switch» (§143) — обрывала соединения группы на ровном месте (заметно у
  автоматизаций, дёргающих одну ноду по таймеру). Теперь такой запрос — no-op:
  соединения не рвутся, re-select не выполняется. Вместо ложного
  `ACTIVE_NODE_CHANGED` (нода не менялась) шлётся новое событие
  `NODE_ALREADY_ACTIVE` (`tag`, `group`, категория **State**), чтобы Tasker/
  MacroDroid-сценарии с Wait Event получали подтверждение, а не уходили в
  timeout. Гейт общий для UI и automation: тап по уже активной ноде в списке
  тоже не дёргает сеть. См. `docs/AUTOMATION.md` (раздел request-response).

- **§287 — долгая остановка VPN при большом числе WG/AWG-эндпоинтов**. Нажатие
  «Стоп» во время активного массового пинга могло висеть 10+ секунд
  (device-verified: 10.2 с с пингом против 0.16 с без). Корень — urltest
  открывает реальные соединения через каждую WG-ноду, а libbox при остановке
  синхронно ждёт их teardown; чем больше WG-нод, тем дольше. Исправлено с двух
  сторон: ядровая половина (SPEC 030) глушит idle/urltest-тик, заранее закрывает
  WG-UDP-сокеты, прерывает in-flight ping-wake и закрывает эндпоинты
  конкурентно — ни один шаг teardown не пропущен; app-таймаут снижен 10с→3с.
  Остановка теперь ~3 секунды.

- **§286 — пинг детерминированно останавливается при остановке/паузе VPN**.
  После снятия guard'а §130 всплыло «UI подвисает на остановке ядра»: фоновый
  probe папки (например, «WARP GENERATOR» на ~100 узлов) продолжал молотить по
  живому ядру после Stop / ухода в фон — его останавливал только экран папки,
  а жизненный цикл VPN/приложения на него не влиял. Теперь весь пинг привязан к
  жизненному циклу (реестр ProbeLifecycle) и гарантированно глохнет на
  stop / revoke / pause; обновления UI батчатся (~120 мс).

- **§282 — QUIC-узлы (Hysteria2 / TUIC) с uTLS/reality больше не гарантированно
  мёртвые**. Публичные подписки в стиле xray несут на hy2/tuic поля
  fingerprint/reality, которые для QUIC в ядре недостижимы (STDConfig падает,
  QUIC-путь всё равно откатывается на него) — каждый такой узел гарантированно
  падал на дозвоне. Теперь эти блоки срезаются на импорте (подмена fingerprint
  на std-TLS запрещена: Go-hello вместо Chrome — регресс безопасности), и узел
  оживает. См. аудит ядра SPEC 027.

- **§281 — неизвестный uTLS-fingerprint больше не роняет весь конфиг**.
  Публичные подписки несут xray-имена отпечатков (`hellochrome_120`, `QQ` и
  пр.), которые sing-box отвергает при сборке outbound'а — один битый узел ронял
  **всю** конфигурацию. Теперь отпечаток нормализуется: точные псевдонимы
  (`hello*`-префикс) маппятся молча, неизвестный мусор → `chrome` с
  предупреждением; остальные узлы живут. Нормализация применяется во всех
  парсерах (vless/trojan/vmess/anytls/proxy-https/hysteria2 URI, xray JSON, raw
  sing-box JSON) плюс safety-net перед валидацией конфига.

- **§236 — тест узлов папки при активном VPN больше не вводит в заблуждение**.
  Проверить узлы папки через probe-сессию поверх живого туннеля нельзя (два
  CommandServer на процесс недопустимы). Раньше при включённом VPN тест молча
  уходил на боевое ядро: замер шёл поверх активного детура/цепочки боевого
  конфига (а не по чистой ноде), выключенные члены выпадали — результаты врали.
  Теперь при активном VPN тест не запускается: попап-гейт «VPN is running» с
  кнопками Stop VPN (останавливает и авто-прогоняет тест) и Cancel.

- **§130 — AmneziaWG поверх WireGuard-детура снова разрешён**. Ядровый guard,
  делавший AWG-over-WireGuard нерабочим, снят (sing-box-lx SPEC 007): на текущем
  графте AWG-нода, детурящая через обычный WireGuard-эндпоинт, поднимается и
  проводит трафик (проверено end-to-end). Приложение больше не прячет
  WireGuard-цели детура от AmneziaWG-узлов (убран фильтр `excludeWireguard` и
  сброс сохранённого детура).

### Changed

- **Ядро обновлено `v1.14.0-lx.9` → `v1.14.0-lx.15`** (device-verified на
  CPH2411; SHA256 AAR сверен). Ключевое:
  - **lx.15** — фикс XHTTP за reverse-proxy (SPEC 002): VLESS+XHTTP через
    nginx/CDN с `mode:packet-up`, trailing-slash path (`/upload/`) и
    `session_placement:header` раньше падал «301 Moved Permanently» (клиент
    безусловно срезал trailing slash для всех mode; теперь — только для
    bare-path stream-one). Дефолтные конфиги (session id в path) не
    затрагивались. Плюс merge upstream testing (async DNS refactor, WG detour
    fix по SPEC 029, OpenConnect auth-challenge и прочие фиксы).
  - **lx.14** — SPEC 030 (stop-latency, ядровая половина §287, см. Fixed).
  - **lx.11** — снят guard AmneziaWG-over-WireGuard (§130, см. Fixed).

## [2.15.10] — 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **§278 — осиротевший экран папки: авто-закрытие вместо немых отказов**.
  Если папку удаляли извне при открытом её экране (Debug API
  `DELETE /folders/{id}` или `DELETE /subs/{id}` c id папки; restore из
  backup), экран продолжал выглядеть полностью рабочим — даже не
  перерисовывался, — но каждое действие (тоггл/тап/reorder/добавление/
  переименование) молча умирало во внутренних orphan-гейтах: тот же
  анти-паттерн «немой гейт», что §277, размазанный по ~15 обработчикам.
  Теперь экран слушает контроллер и при исчезновении entry закрывается сам
  (аккуратно и когда поверх открыт диалог/шит: снимается именно свой роут).
  Попутно: «Export to clipboard» в пикере приложений работал, но молча
  глотался во время загрузки списка — экспорт зависит только от выбора и
  исключён из гейта.

- **§277 — «Suspend active-route tunnels» молча не сохранялся** (репорт с
  форума: «ставлю Off, выхожу-захожу — снова 5 минут; другие значения не
  запоминаются»). Дропдаун зависит от базового порога «Suspend idle tunnels»
  (§272: ядро отвергает reachable-окно без базового), но зависимость была
  выражена ранним `return` внутри `onChanged` — контрол выглядел рабочим,
  показывал выбранное, а запись молча отбрасывалась, пока базовый порог в Off;
  при следующем входе на экран значение «откатывалось» к сохранённому/дефолту.
  Теперь зависимость честная: при выключенном базовом пороге дропдаун
  неактивен (серый), в подсказке указано условие; при включённом — любой выбор
  сохраняется. Хранимое значение переживает выключение базового порога.

## [2.15.11] — 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **AmneziaWG-нода в роли detour снова проводит трафик** (ядро
  `v1.14.0-lx.9`). Если AmneziaWG-нода использовалась как звено detour-цепочки
  (WG/AWG поверх другого выхода), туннель поднимался «вроде бы», но handshake и
  данные молча отбрасывались — нода была мёртвой. Причина в ядре: обфускация
  reserved-байтов для WARP затирала magic-заголовок AmneziaWG. Заодно —
  устранена гонка данных в кеше detour-bind соединений. Обычный WireGuard и
  AmneziaWG не через detour баг не затрагивал.

## [2.15.9] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **AmneziaWG больше не роняет приложение на первом пакете** (ядро
  `v1.14.0-lx.8-rc.1`). AmneziaWG-профили с `s4 > 0` (transport-padding) при
  первом же пакете данных вызывали SIGABRT из-за переполнения буфера — процесс
  падал. Исправлено; попутно устранён двойной подсчёт скачанных байт у AWG и
  добавлены три guard'а на битые значения конфига (`jmin`/`jmax`, длины `i1`–`i5`,
  full-range magic header). Device-verified: профиль, который падал, теперь
  проводит трафик. Обычный WireGuard (`s4=0`) баг не затрагивал.

## [2.15.8] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **§276 — перехват VPN-слота: починен контракт статуса native↔Dart**. Когда
  слот забирает другое VPN-приложение, юзер видел сырую внутреннюю строку
  `Stopped: VPN revoked by another app` — она читается как поломка приложения,
  хотя описывает штатную ситуацию (Android держит один VPN-слот). Причина: Dart
  ждал статус-строку `'Revoked'`, которой native не слал **никогда** (`VpnStatus`
  = `Stopped`/`Starting`/`Started`/`Stopping`), поэтому `TunnelStatus.revoked`
  был недостижим **с первого коммита репозитория**, а весь UX перехвата
  (§003 SnackBar, §224 честный текст, §241 «VPN settings») — мёртвым кодом.
  Теперь revoke едет флагом рядом со `Stopped`: терминальный статус не меняется
  (на `== Stopped` завязаны stopCompleter, guard `onStartCommand`,
  `isForeignVpnActive`, сброс uptime — пятый статус подвесил бы `stopVPN` до
  таймаута). `getVpnStatus` отдаёт `{status, revoked}` — признак перехвата
  переживает фон (закрыт кейс «silent revoke» из §003). Device-verified на
  CPH2411 — первая живая проверка revoke-UX в истории проекта.
  Закрыт хвост §224 (нативная строка; коммит `528484d` тронул только .dart).
  Не лечит сам перехват — причина внешняя (чужой Always-on VPN, автозапуск,
  Samsung Secure Wi-Fi), но делает её видимой юзеру.

### Removed

- **Дублирующий revoke-SnackBar**. На одно событие перехвата стреляли два
  SnackBar: специализированный (с кнопкой Start) и общий обработчик ошибок
  §166 по `lastError`. Второй делал `hideCurrentSnackBar()` и затирал первый
  через 1–2 с — юзер видел мелькание. Оставлен §166; кнопка Start не нужна
  (главная кнопка Start рядом на экране).

## [2.15.7] — 2026-07-15

### Added

- **§240 — фильтр правил по типу трафика (tcp/udp/icmp)**. Правило
  маршрутизации теперь матчит L4-транспорт: секция **NETWORK & PROTOCOL** в
  редакторе правила (свёрнутый вид с чипами + попап выбора) вместо прежней
  простыни чекбоксов PROTOCOL. Позволяет развести TCP и UDP по разным каналам —
  например, пустить QUIC/игры напрямую, а TCP через VPN. Внутри списка — ИЛИ,
  с остальными условиями правила — И. Поддержано в Debug API (`network` в
  `/rules`). GitHub issue #26. Ядро принимает ровно `tcp`/`udp`/`icmp`
  (`icmpv6` в этом поле не существует).
  Реализовано 05.07.2026, в develop влито 15.07.2026 (ветка была забыта).
  В release-notes v2.15.7 не попал — заметки писались до влития ветки.

### Changed

- Ядро (libbox) v1.14.0-lx.5 → **v1.14.0-lx.7**: третий уровень idle-suspend
  (`route.lx_idle_teardown`) — спящий туннель сносится целиком (освобождается
  gVisor netstack), пробуждение = пересборка на первом дайле (~0.5–1 с);
  наследует окно от `lx_idle_suspend_reachable` (5m), клиентских правок не
  требует. Плюс фикс log-noise `tolerance` в round_robin (#7) и upstream-мержи.

## [2.15.6] — 2026-07-15

### Changed

- **§274 — detour-канал снова доступен целям правил**. Галка «Use as detour»
  теперь **разрешение** (канал можно выбирать как detour-мишень), а не роль:
  канал с галкой остаётся в выборе route final и правил, сосуществует с
  Include block, а установка галки больше не переписывает существующие
  ссылки правил на vpn-1. Галка переименовывает канал: ⚙ становится частью
  имени (как метка detour-серверов) и виден во всех списках; снятие галки
  убирает префикс. Циклы detour, как и раньше, ловит
  fatal-детектор §254. Fallback канала, чей фильтр не нашёл ни одной ноды,
  унифицирован: block для всех (раньше detour-канал молча падал в direct);
  о таком канале теперь сообщает исчезающее уведомление на Home.
- Debug API `/channels`: снят 409 на `detour × include_block` и тихая
  нормализация `include_block`; `healed.rules` при `detour:true` — всегда 0.
- **§275 — мутации каналов через `ChannelMutations`**. Storage-heal detour-ссылок
  и зеркальный ресинк in-memory состояния контроллера стали одной операцией:
  разделить их вызывающий больше не может. Голые
  `SettingsStorage.addChannel/updateChannel/deleteChannel` помечены
  `@visibleForTesting` — вызов из `lib/` мимо сервиса теперь ошибка analyze
  (CI гоняет его на весь проект). Раньше инвариант держался на внимательности
  в шести местах.

### Fixed

- **§275 — `POST /channels` терял вылеченные detour-ссылки**. Создание канала
  с полем `enabled:false` лечило stale detour-ссылки в storage (сценарий:
  restore из backup оставил ссылку на канал, которого нет), но не зеркалило
  heal в память контроллера — следующее сохранение (переименование источника,
  переключение члена папки, авто-обновление подписки) возвращало вылеченную
  ссылку на диск, а сборка конфига брала её вопреки показанному уведомлению.
  `PATCH` и `DELETE` того же хендлера зеркалили правильно. Затрагивало только
  Debug API; через UI не воспроизводилось.


## [2.15.5] — 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Ядро (libbox) v1.14.0-lx.4-rc.2 → **v1.14.0-lx.5** (stable): энергоревизия
  промоутнута после device-verification на v2.15.4; код ядра идентичен rc.2.

## [2.15.4] — 2026-07-15

### Added

- **§272 — энергосвязка с ядром v1.14.0-lx.4-rc.2**: секция VPN Settings →
  System → **WireGuard connections** (Suspend idle tunnels 30s / Suspend
  active-route tunnels 5m — `route.lx_idle_suspend[_reachable]`); **Passive
  health check** (вкл. по умолчанию, `urltest.passive_check`) — пробы молчат,
  пока живой трафик подтверждает сервер; интервал health-check новых каналов
  5m → 15m (три источника дефолта + подсказка в редакторе канала).

### Changed

- Ядро (libbox) v1.14.0-lx.3 → **v1.14.0-lx.4-rc.2**: энергоревизия
  idle-suspend × urltest (pause-wake воскрешение, обрывы живых соединений,
  AWG-over-WG guard-дыры, probe-хвост брошенных групп; полный список — в
  lx-changelog ядра). §273 — разбор клиент-аудита (config-generator ось).

## [2.15.3] — 2026-07-15

### Added

- **§271 — настраиваемый memory limit ядра**. VPN Settings → System →
  Optimization → **Memory limit**: Auto (дефолт, по RAM устройства: <3.5 GiB →
  200 MB, 3.5–7 GiB → 384 MB, ≥7 GiB → 512 MB) / Off / 200–768 MB. Заменяет
  захардкоженный `oomMemoryLimit = 200MB` (§173, с v2.10.0), который на конфигах
  с большими WG-пулами вызывал GC-шторм и перегрев CPU (pprof: 304% CPU, ~88% —
  GC). Применяется к работающему ядру мгновенно через `Libbox.reloadSetupOptions`.
  При Off сторож памяти ядра остаётся активен (следит за системной свободной
  памятью). Хранится как ключ `memory_limit` в §189 `native_prefs`, входит в
  backup-блок `vpn_settings`.

---

## [2.15.2] — 2026-07-10

### Added

- **§269 — протокол AnyTLS**. Полная поддержка AnyTLS (sing-box `type: anytls`):
  модель `AnyTlsSpec`, URI-парсер (`anytls://password@host:port?...`), разбор
  sing-box JSON, эмиттер. TLS всегда включён; REALITY (`pbk`/`sid`), uTLS, ALPN,
  поля idle-сессий. Импорт через вставку / «Add server» / QR. Закрывает #38.

### Fixed

- **§270 — TLS Fragment ломал naive-узлы**. Post-step TLS Fragment проставлял
  `tls.fragment` всем TLS-узлам, но ядро отвергает его для naive fatal
  (`fragment is not supported on naive outbound`). Fragment больше не
  применяется к naive.

---

## [2.15.1] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- **§268 — импорт `naive+https://` и `masque://` по прямой ссылке**. Парсер
  этих схем существовал, но классификатор входного импорта (`isDirectLink`)
  их не перечислял — вставка / «Add server» / QR падали с «Input is not a
  subscription URL, proxy link, or outbound JSON». Обе схемы теперь
  распознаются как прямые ссылки.

### Changed

- **§268 — плюс-алиасы схемы HTTP(S)-прокси**. К `proxy-http://` /
  `proxy-https://` добавлены эквивалентные `proxy+http://` / `proxy+https://`
  (единый «плюс»-стиль со схемой `naive+https://`). TLS-дискриминатор
  `parseHttpProxy` перешёл с точного сравнения на суффикс `https` — покрывает
  дефис- и плюс-форму.

---

## [2.15.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added

- **§264 — Traffic Processing: единый пресет предобработки трафика**. Sniff,
  hijack-DNS и resolve собраны в один закреплённый пресет **Traffic
  Processing** (первый в списке правил, `pinned: 0` — `sniff` обязан быть
  первым). Пресет **нельзя выключить/удалить/подвинуть** (`locked`): свич
  disabled, drag-handle и delete скрыты. Настройки в одном месте: Packet
  sniffing, Sniff timeout (был хардкод `1s`), Hijack DNS, Resolve destination
  IP, Resolve strategy. Все пресеты переведены на объект `ui`
  (label/description/default/locked/pinned), плоские поля убраны. Нормализация
  в билдере (`normalize_pinned_presets`) гарантирует наличие+позицию пресета
  для существующих юзеров (upgrade-safe).
- **§265 — ref-vars и системная секция `internal`**. Синтаксис `{"ref":
  "<var>"}` — пресет ссылается на глобальную переменную вместо собственной
  копии (значение в общем `userVars`, метаданные из целевой). Секция `internal`
  (chapter не рендерится ни одним экраном) хранит `resolve_enabled` /
  `resolve_strategy` — их **нет в VPN Settings**, они видны и правятся только
  в правиле Traffic Processing.
- **§266 — FakeIP автоматически глушит route-resolve**. Псевдо-переменная
  `@rule_enable` (включён ли пресет) + `on_change`: пока FakeIP активен
  (`@rule_enable AND @dns_enable`), `resolve_enabled` выключается автоматически
  — route-resolve обесценивает FakeIP (§263) и утыкается в системный DNS.
  Выключишь FakeIP или его DNS-тумблер — resolve возвращается. Движок
  `preset_on_change` общий (любой пресет), срабатывает из всех точек: создание
  пресета, свич в списке, редактор, DNS Settings.
- **§263 — тумблер Resolve destination IP + FakeIP глушит HTTPS/SVCB**. Гейт
  глобального route-resolve (переехал в §264); FakeIP-пресет отвечает пустым
  `NOERROR` на HTTPS/SVCB-запросы (type 65/64), чтобы они не текли в системный
  DNS.
- **§262 — детектор здоровья DNS в профайлере + баннер решений**. Постоянный
  детектор в `TrafficProfiler` (не разовое окно на старте, как выпиленный §259):
  видит весь поток DNS-событий, пока идёт запись. При массовом провале резолва
  на живом туннеле показывает баннер на вкладке Live с готовыми действиями —
  Route DNS through VPN / Use operator DNS. Опирается на §261 (DNS-события
  теперь неотделимы от профайлера).
- **§258 — View-экран ноды**. Вкладки Overview/JSON + кликабельная рантайм-
  цепочка detour.
- **§257 — DNS-блок правила: dns_enable-тумблер + объединённый Server/Force
  IPv4**. Мастер-тумблер DNS-аспекта пресета; Server-строка двухступенчатая,
  Force IPv4 виден в DNS Settings при взведённой галке.
- **⚠️-предупреждения в тултипах** Hijack DNS и Packet sniffing: что именно
  ломается при отключении (FakeIP/DNS-правила; protocol-матч BitTorrent/TLS/
  QUIC и domain-матч без FakeIP).

### Fixed

- **§264 — FakeIP не прописывал DNS** (device-caught). Псевдо-переменная
  `rule_enable` без `default_value` считалась required → развёртка пресета
  прерывалась молча, fakeip-сервер и dns_rules не эмитились. FakeIP выглядел
  включённым, но не работал. Фикс: `default_value` + `required: false`.
- **§264 — коммент-ключ в `config.route` ронял старт ядра**. sing-box
  strict-decode не знает поля `//` → fatal cold-start.
- **§264 — `@vpn_mode` не резолвился в правилах пресета** → пустой `inbound`
  у sniff/resolve. Глобальные vars теперь прокидываются в развёртку пресета.
- **§264 — пресет не появлялся в списке правил** у существующих юзеров
  (нормализация жила только в билдере; UI/storage её не видели).
- **§264 — locked-гейты в редакторе правила**: свич выключения и delete-
  иконка были доступны для locked-пресета; имя пресета теперь read-only.

### Changed

- **§264 — базовые sniff/hijack-dns/resolve убраны из `config.route.rules`**
  шаблона (переехали в пресет Traffic Processing). `resolve_enabled` /
  `resolve_strategy` убраны из секции Network (VPN Settings) — теперь в
  секции `internal`, доступны через пресет.
- **§263 частично заменён §264** — `resolve_enabled` переехал из VPN Settings
  в пресет Traffic Processing (поведение то же).
- **§261 — DNS-стрим переведён на command-мультиплекс CommandClient** (смена
  парадигмы обвязки). Раньше DNS-журнал (§180, ядро SPEC 018) жил отдельной
  ручной подпиской `subscribeDNSQueries()` → `DnsQuerySubscription` /
  `DnsQueryHandler`, повешенной на живой `profilerClient` вне мультиплекса.
  Такая подписка **не переживала уход в фон / Doze**: gRPC-стрим не был частью
  `Connect()`-мультиплекса, поэтому при реконнекте ядро переподнимало
  connections, но не DNS — поток глох (симптом: DNS-события шли ~47с после
  старта и умирали навсегда, детектор дальше слушал пустоту). Теперь DNS —
  обычный член мультиплекса: `addCommand(CommandDNS)` + `setDNSIncludeAnswers`,
  события приходят через `ProfilerHandler.writeDNSQuery` (тело 1:1 из бывшего
  `DnsHandler.onQuery`) и **живут / умирают / реконнектятся вместе с клиентом**,
  идентично `CommandConnections`. Клиентский reconnect-хук из отменённого §260
  (`profilerWanted` + патч в `disconnected`) удалён за ненадобностью — корень
  починен в ядре. Требует `libbox` ≥ `v1.14.0-lx.3` (SPEC 018 v2, ветка
  `lx-spec018-dns-multiplex`). Классы `DnsQuerySubscription` / `DnsQueryHandler`
  и метод `subscribeDNSQueries` из обвязки удалены.
- Утилита `format_wizard_template.py` + раздел Formatting style в TEMPLATE.md
  — правила оформления шаблона.

---

## [2.14.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- **§254 — detour-циклы: fatal-детектор с виновниками**. Автоматический
  edge-strip detour-циклов заменён детектором в `validateConfig`: при цикле
  конфиг не собирается (fatal), а UI показывает bottom sheet со списком
  **нод-виновников** (минимальный набор — SCC + окраска, cap на первые
  несколько) и разбором петли при раскрытии. Ловится до отдачи в ядро,
  которое такие кольца и так отвергает на старте.
- **§255 — навигация к владельцу ноды**. Тап по виновнику в окне ошибки
  открывает источник ноды: папка → экран папки с подсветкой члена; подписка →
  экран настроек; одиночный сервер → Node Settings. Скролл к строке с retry
  для элементов за пределами вьюпорта.
- **§256 — Force IPv4 на пользовательском правиле**. Галка **Force IPv4 (drop
  AAAA)** в DNS-секции редактора правила: гасит IPv6-ответы для матча правила
  serverless-правилом `{ip_version: 6, action: predefined, rcode: NOERROR}`.
  Ортогональна «Send DNS to dedicated server». Продолжение §253 (тот же Force
  IPv4, теперь на своих правилах, не только в пресете).

### Fixed

- **Detour из подписок «выпиливался» при генерации** (§248-регрессия). Старый
  edge-strip снимал detour у всех членов замыкаемого канала (150 транзитных
  нод вместо 1 виновника) и молчал — выглядело как потеря маршрутизации.

### Changed

- Разрыв detour-циклов больше не автоматический: флагман-кейс §248 (relay в
  подписке под override на свой канал) теперь тоже fatal с виновником-релеем.

---

## [2.13.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added

- **§248 — detour-каналы**: галка **Use as detour** превращает канал (значок
  ⚙) в переключаемую detour-прослойку — цель detour для серверов/папок/
  подписок, исключённую из целей правил. Переключение канала (вручную или
  Auto по urltest) пересаживает весь детурящийся флот на другой upstream
  одним действием. Билдер разрывает циклы edge-strip'ом (сервер остаётся в
  канале, снимается цикл-образующий detour); пустой detour-канал → direct;
  block в прослойке запрещён. Parse-гейт инвариантов (`vpn-1` не detour,
  detour ⇒ без block). Heal ссылок при смене роли/disable/delete с in-memory
  ресинком контроллера. Debug API `/channels` поле `detour` + 409-инварианты
  + `healed`-счётчики. Device-verified.
- **§252 — превью цепочки detour** в настройках подписок и папок
  разворачивает всю трассу (цель → её detour → … → канал с текущим выбором),
  паритет с одиночными серверами.

### Changed

- **§251/§252 — routing-строки читаются по ходу пакета**: справа от `:`
  физический путь слева направо (вход → хопы → выход → назначение); пара
  «селектор и его текущий выбор» схлопнута в `селектор (выбор)` (вложенно
  для Auto-каналов). Держатель `SelectorInfo` (теги групп + выборы из живых
  данных). Применено в карточке соединения, Live, Conns, per-app trace.

### Fixed

- **§246 — VPN не стартовал при включённом FakeIP-пресете и Force IPv4**:
  ядро 1.14 отвергает legacy-`strategy` в DNS-правиле вместе с FakeIP
  («initialize dns router: Legacy strategy … deprecated»). Убрана
  legacy-`strategy` из DNS-аспекта RU-пресетов; Force IPv4 работает.
  Device-verified.
- **§250 — `last_start_error`**: причина падения старта в Debug API
  (`GET /state`) держится до первого успешного подключения (UI гасил
  мгновенно — через API поймать было нельзя). In-memory.

## [2.12.0] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **§246 — российские сайты не открывались при включённом IPv6** на сетях без
  рабочего глобального IPv6: приложения получали AAAA и коннектились по IPv6,
  RU-трафик шёл напрямую (direct) в мёртвую v6-сеть → ERR_CONNECTION_RESET.
  Двухслойный фикс за галкой **Force IPv4** (default on) в пресетах
  «Russian domains & IPs» / «Russia-only services»: DNS-правило пресета
  отдаёт только A-записи + route-`resolve` со `strategy: ipv4_only` для
  доменных соединений. IPv6 в туннеле не затронут. Device-verified.
- **§202 — VPN не стартовал после удаления канала, на который смотрел пресет
  с явным override**: `_healChannelRefs` не лечил `varsValues['outbound']` →
  dangling outbound → fatal. Теперь heal kind-agnostic.
- **§247 — битая ссылка resolve-правила на DNS-сервер** (выключенный
  DNS-аспект пресета / удалённый сервер) валила каждое сматчившееся
  соединение лениво («DNS server not found») — ядро не ловит это на старте,
  валидатор не видел. Новый пост-степ `healDanglingResolveServers`: битый
  `server` снимается с warning, резолв деградирует в DNS-роутинг.

### Added

- **§247 — окно «Action & Resolve»** у пользовательских inline/srs-правил
  (шестерёнка у Action-пикера): режимы Route / Route + Resolve first /
  Resolve only (advanced, с предупреждением), стратегия ipv4/ipv6,
  выбор DNS-сервера, advanced-опции (cache/TTL/timeout/client subnet),
  живой preview эмитируемых правил, значок ✳ в списке правил. Модель
  `RuleResolve` + Debug API `/rules` поле `resolve` (strict-валидация).
- **§246 — `rules`-массив у пресетов шаблона**: пресет эмитит несколько
  route-правил в порядке шаблона; `#if`-гейты на элементах; override/
  reject-backstop только терминальным (resolve/sniff/route-options —
  промежуточные); поэлементный dangling-guard; `terminalRule` для UI.
  E2e-тесты на реальном `wizard_template.json`.

### Changed

- **§249 — дефолт стратегии резолва: `ipv4_only`** (`dns_strategy` +
  `resolve_strategy`); тумблер Enable IPv6 развязан от prefer_ipv6:
  включение → `prefer_ipv4`, выключение → `ipv4_only` (оба направления
  детерминированы). Ручная настройка — DNS Settings → Strategy. Миграции
  нет: сохранённый prefer_ipv6 уходит при первом переключении тумблера.

---

## [2.11.1] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **§243 — регрессия v2.11.0: правка Tag не меняла имя в списке Servers**
  (фидбэк 4PDA). Имя файла при импорте `.conf` писалось в отдельное поле
  `name` записи, затмевавшее tag. Теперь имя файла пробрасывается до
  конвертации INI→URI и становится фрагментом синтетического URI (= tag
  узла); поле `name` у одиночных серверов упразднено (displayName игнорирует,
  затирается при пересохранении; миграции нет — осознанно).
- **§243 — члены папки из `.conf`-файлов назывались одинаковым «WireGuard»**
  (фидбэк 4PDA). Служебный фрагмент `#WireGuard` синтетического URI считался
  «собственным именем» ноды, и имя файла отбрасывалось. После §243 фрагмент —
  настоящее имя файла, папочный путь чинится той же точкой.
- **§244 — фильтр профайлера слетал при переключении вкладок** (фидбэк 4PDA).
  Фильтр жил в State вкладки и умирал вместе с ним. Теперь — session-холдер
  `ProfilerFilters` (два независимых инстанса App/Live): переживает
  переключение вкладок и уход со Stats-экрана; сбрасывается перезапуском
  приложения (persist'а нет, осознанно).

### Changed

- **§243 — визард SOCKS/HTTP**: поля «Tag» и «Display name (optional)» слиты
  в одно **Tag (optional)**; введённое имя = tag узла (живёт в rawBody,
  переживает рестарт), пустое → прежний дефолт `local-socks5-out` /
  `local-http-out`.
- **§245 — «Add detour»**: toggle «Replace existing chain» заменён на два
  явных режима **Replace all** (replaceDetourChain=true) / **Fill missing**
  (false, default). Только формулировки UI — семантика билдера, storage и
  Debug API (`replace_detour_chain`) не менялись.

### Added

- **§241 — кнопка «VPN settings»** в диалоге «Another VPN is active» —
  открывает системный Settings → VPN (`ACTION_VPN_SETTINGS`), где активный
  перехватчик слота помечен «Connected».
- **§242 — Stats: попап детализации памяти** (Dalvik/Native/Code/Stack/
  Graphics/Other из `Debug.MemoryInfo`) по тапу на чип памяти; чип
  Connections ведёт на вкладку Conns; подпись памяти `sing-box` → `LxBox`
  (цифра = RSS всего процесса).

### Internal

- Версионирование: `pubspec.yaml` заморожен на placeholder `0.0.0+1`,
  версия/versionCode вычисляются из git-тега в момент сборки (CI и
  `build-local-apk.sh`, restore через trap EXIT); pre-commit sync-hook удалён.

---

## [2.11.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added

- **§234 — папки серверов** (по фидбэку 4PDA). Контейнер для ручных серверов:
  импорт нескольких файлов разом (multi-select, имена нод из имён файлов),
  вставка из буфера, добавление по ссылке (одноразовый снимок). Общий тумблер,
  tag-префикс и detour на всю папку; перенос сервера одиночный ↔ папка и между
  папками. Подписки в папки не кладутся. Имя одиночного сервера из файла — по
  имени файла.
- **§236 — Test servers**: проверка серверов папки без запуска VPN
  (headless-экземпляр ядра без туннеля). Задержка цветом шкалы (настраиваемые
  пороги), `err`/`broken`-вердикты, массовые Disable slower / Delete
  unreachable / Sort by ping.
- **§237/§239 — настройка сервера в папке**: тот же экран, что у одиночного
  (тег/эмодзи/detour/JSON); личный detour на другой сервер той же папки —
  цепочка внутри папки с полной detour-симметрией с подписками (интра-цепочки,
  разрыв циклов, ⚙-маркировка звеньев, единый пикер цели).
- **§238 — Debug API**: CRUD папок (`/folders/*`, включая `POST
  /folders/{id}/probe`) и каналов роутинга (`/channels/*`).
- **§130 — MASQUE-транспорт** (h3/h2) в строке ноды на главном.

### Changed

- **§235 — фильтр нод «Subscribes» → «Sources»**: фильтрует ноды по подпискам
  И папкам (по общему tag-префиксу).

---

## [2.10.2] — 2026-07-04

### Added

- **§231 — метка «DNS» на правилах маршрутизации** (по фидбэку 4PDA). В списке
  Routing Rules теперь видно, какие правила затрагивают настройки DNS (вносят
  DNS-сервер или DNS-правило) — раньше, глядя на список, это было неочевидно.
  Чип **DNS** появляется у пресетов с DNS-аспектом (FakeIP, Russian domains) и
  у пользовательских правил с включённым DNS-mirror; в строке — под
  outbound-переключателем, в редакторе пресета — в шапке. Приглушается, когда
  правило выключено. В редакторе таких правил — информативный блок-пояснение,
  что правило добавляет DNS-сервер/правило в DNS Settings.

### Changed

- **§233 — минимальный Android понижен: 8.0 → 7.0** (API 26 → 24, по запросу
  пользователей со старыми устройствами). Приложение теперь ставится на
  Android 7.0/7.1. Код не менялся — все нужные version-гейты уже были на
  месте (ниже API 24 не пускает сам Flutter). Тир 7.x — best-effort, как
  8–10: базовый VPN работает, регулярно не тестируется. Известное ограничение
  Android 7.0: в системе нет корневого сертификата Let's Encrypt (ISRG Root
  X1) — подписки с таких HTTPS-источников не загрузятся (на 7.1.1+ корень
  есть).
- **§232 — IPv6 и кастомные маршруты стали opt-in** (защита от регрессий
  §227). Две новые галки в VPN Settings → TUN, обе по умолчанию **выключены**:
  - **Enable IPv6** — добавляет IPv6-адрес на туннель и при переключении
    ставит стратегии резолва (`prefer_ipv6` при включении, `prefer_ipv4` при
    выключении; потом можно поменять вручную);
  - **Custom tunnel routes** — явный `route_address` (заворот всего v4+v6
    половинками) вместо автоматического `0.0.0.0/0`.

  С выключенными галками конфиг идентичен поведению до v2.10.0 — если IPv6 или
  явные маршруты что-то ломали в вашей сети, после обновления это уйдёт само.
  Кто пользуется IPv6 — включите галку заново. Дефолты стратегий возвращены на
  `prefer_ipv4`.
- **§232 — настройки стали реактивными.** Значения на экране настроек живут в
  единой модели с per-key подпиской (`VarValuesModel`): программные изменения
  (галка → стратегии) мгновенно видны в связанных полях, изменения
  сохраняются на выходе с экрана одним записью. Исправлен баг, из-за которого
  автопереключение стратегий не сохранялось.

## [2.10.1] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **§230 — фильтр профайлера по правилам и каналам.** В окне фильтра
  соединений появились две новые оси: **Rule** (по какому route-правилу прошло
  соединение; без правила → «final») и **Outbound** (по любому звену
  маршрута — селектор, канал или detour-транспорт вроде WARP). Плюс над
  вкладками добавлено **поле поиска** (domain / IP / app): клик по домену в
  детали соединения кладёт значение туда, его видно, можно править и очистить
  крестиком (раньше фильтр применялся, но нигде не отображался и снимался
  только через «Reset all»). Списки Rule/Outbound собираются из текущего
  трафика; оси комбинируются как и прежние (Protocol/App).

## [2.10.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **§228 — FakeIP DNS-пресет.** Новый selectable-пресет **FakeIP** (по умолчанию
  выключен): DNS-сервер `type: fakeip` (пулы `198.18.0.0/15` + `fc00::/18`) +
  правило, заворачивающее все A/AAAA-запросы на него. Приложение получает
  placeholder-IP мгновенно (0 latency, нет pre-tunnel DNS-утечки), реальный
  резолв доменов происходит внутри туннеля. Пресет стоит **после** пресетов с
  GeoIP-роутингом (напр. «Russian domains & IPs») — их домены резолвятся
  по-настоящему, иначе IP-правило (`geoip-*`) по фейк-IP не сработало бы. В
  базовый конфиг добавлен
  `experimental.cache_file.store_fakeip: true` — таблица фейк↔домен переживает
  реконнекты (иначе после переподключения залипают соединения, пока приложения
  не перезапросят DNS). Не анти-DPI (DPI режет по SNI, а не DNS). Ограничение:
  GeoIP-роутинг по чисто-IP правилам слабеет — приложения видят фейк-IP.
  Порядок базовых route-правил изменён на `sniff → hijack-dns → resolve` (был
  `resolve` первым) — sniff извлекает домен до резолва, что необходимо для
  FakeIP и корректно для обычного роутинга. В строке правила outbound-переключатель
  теперь показывается только у пресетов с выбором канала; hidden-параметры
  пресета больше не рисуются в редакторе.
- **Пресеты правил — выбор канала для BitTorrent / Private IPs / Russia-only.**
  Правила **BitTorrent**, **Private IPs** и **Russia-only services** больше не
  прибиты к «direct» — у них появился выбор outbound-канала (BitTorrent в
  отдельный канал, Private IPs к удалённому роутеру через VPN, Russia-only
  через российский канал из-за рубежа). По умолчанию — по-прежнему direct.
  Правила BitTorrent и Private IPs переименованы (убран суффикс «direct»);
  ранее выбранные настройки сохраняются автоматически при обновлении.

### Changed

- **§227 — полноценный IPv6 в туннеле.** Раньше TUN поднимал только
  IPv4-адрес, а стратегии резолва стояли на `prefer_ipv4` — при рабочем
  IPv6 у провайдера трафик всё равно сваливался в IPv4. Теперь у tun-инбаунда
  два адреса (`["@tun_address", "@tun_address6"]`, новый var `tun_address6`
  = ULA `fdfe:dcba:9876::1/126`) и явный `route_address`
  (`0.0.0.0/1`+`128.0.0.0/1`+`::/1`+`8000::/1`) — весь IPv4 и весь IPv6
  заворачиваются в туннель половинками (без конфликта с системным
  default-route). Дефолты `dns_strategy` и `resolve_strategy` →
  `prefer_ipv6` (сначала IPv6, при отсутствии AAAA — IPv4; безопасно и для
  сетей без IPv6). Явный IPv6-`route_address` нужен для Android < 13, где нет
  native-fallback `::/0`. Native-обвязка (`BoxVpnService.openTun`) уже умела
  прокидывать inet6-адрес в `VpnService` — изменён только шаблон. DNS-серверы
  оставлены на IPv4-адресах (v6-адреса резолверов доступны ручным выбором).

---

## [2.9.2] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- **§225 — тип правила «Raw JSON»** в редакторе маршрутизации (GitHub #17).
  Третий вид правила рядом с Inline / Remote (.srs): юзер пишет сырое тело
  route-правила (JSON-объект или массив объектов), билдер кладёт его в
  `route.rules` как есть. Открывает любой sing-box route-action
  (`hijack-dns` / `sniff` / `resolve` / `route-options` …) без отдельной
  формы под каждое поле — действие часть тела. Битый JSON / скаляр → правило
  пропускается с предупреждением (конфиг не падает); dangling `outbound`
  внутри тела ловит существующий валидатор. Также доступно через Debug API
  (`kind: "json"`).
- **§222 — протокол HTTP(S)-прокси** (sing-box `type: http`). URI-схемы
  `proxy-http://` / `proxy-https://` (кастомные: голые `http(s)://` заняты
  URL-ами подписок, а промо-ссылки в телах превращались бы в мусорные узлы),
  полный набор полей sing-box (auth/path/headers/TLS), приём через тела
  подписок / paste URI / paste JSON / JSON-редактор ноды, новый таб **HTTP**
  в Add server wizard (host/port/auth + switch «HTTPS (TLS)»).

### Changed

- **§226 — горизонтальный скролл табов в Add server wizard.** TabBar сделан
  прокручиваемым (`isScrollable`): вкладки берут естественную ширину и
  скроллятся по горизонтали вместо сжатия/обрезки. С ростом числа протоколов
  (§222 добавил HTTP) подписи больше не наезжают друг на друга. Прижаты к
  левому краю (`TabAlignment.start`, тот же приём, что в App Settings §158).

### Fixed

- **§223 — подтекст уведомления замораживался на ноде момента старта**
  (GitHub #20). Смена ноды без Stop/Start (selector или URLTest-автовыбор)
  не обновляла шторку: Dart слал свежие лейблы (§123), но native их только
  кэшировал — рендер был лишь на connect. Теперь изменение лейбла при
  `Started`-туннеле перерисовывает уведомление тем же путём, что и
  connect-рендер (кнопки §182 не стекаются), с дедупом по фактическому
  изменению строки. Бонус для #23: после старта с QS-плитки шторка
  обновляется, как только открыто приложение (лейблы прилетают с groups-push).
- **§223 Часть B — подтекст уведомления при старте без UI** (GitHub #23,
  частично). При старте с QS-плитки / launcher-shortcut Flutter-движка может
  не быть, и подтекст оставался `Connected`. Теперь через ~3 с после Started
  native сам читает выбранную ноду одним unary-pull'ом (`getGroups()` поверх
  lifecycle-независимого ping-клиента — без новой фоновой подписки, энергомодель
  не трогаем) и рисует `<группа>: <нода>`. Ловит начальную ноду; если UI открыт
  (Dart уже прислал лейбл) — native молчит.
- **§224 — понятный текст при перехвате VPN другим приложением** (4PDA).
  Сообщение «VPN taken/revoked by another app» вводило в заблуждение: юзер
  думал, что приложение считает своё же прошлое подключение за чужое. На деле
  системный VPN-слот (он один на Android) в окне Stop→Start перехватывает
  другой Always-on / kill-switch VPN — revoke настоящий. Три видимые строки
  переписаны самодостаточно: объясняют, что слот занял другой VPN, и что нужно
  нажать Start. Логика teardown/reconnect не менялась.

---

## [2.9.1] — 2026-07-02

**Глубокий аудит проекта (§219)** — релиз стабилизации без новых флагманских
фич. Прогон по всему коду (`develop` после v2.9.0) вскрыл и закрыл серию багов
логики, которые не ловит статический анализ: висячая `route.final`, потеря
`reserved`/`outboundType`, две утечки `http.Client`, гонки use-after-dispose,
удаление не той подписки после reorder, потеря `masque_account` при restore
бэкапа. Плюс уборка мёртвого кода, дедуп повторяющихся паттернов, микро-оптимизации
горячих путей и синхронизация документации с кодом. Единственная новая фича —
переключатель **«Allow rotation»** (§220) по фидбэку планшетных юзеров.

### Added

- **§220 — toggle «Allow rotation»** (App Settings → General → Behavior):
  снимает портретную фиксацию — ориентацию решает системный auto-rotate.
  Default OFF (портрет, как раньше). Применяется сразу, без рестарта.
  По фидбэку планшетных юзеров с 4PDA.

### Fixed

- **§219 — глубокий аудит: исправлены баги логики.** `route.final` на auto-двойник
  канала с пустым node-set давал висячую ссылку (fatal старта sing-box) — билдер
  теперь строит `validFinals` из фактически эмитированных outbound'ов, а validator
  симметрично проверяет `route.final`. WireGuard из JSON-парсера не заполнял
  `reserved` (WARP-трафик не шёл) и давал иной дефолт MTU, чем URI-парсер —
  унифицировано. Две утечки `http.Client` (подписки, community-loader). `expire=0`
  подписки трактовался как timestamp эпохи 1970 вместо «нет срока». Профайлер терял
  `outboundType` (§204) при resolve/backfill. Гонки use-after-dispose в
  `home_controller`. Экран деталей подписки удалял/переименовывал НЕ ту подписку
  после drag-reorder (`widget.index` устарел). Пустой SSID в ручном добавлении
  Wi-Fi молча ничего не делал.
- **§130/§219 — `masque_account` терялся при restore бэкапа** (не был в
  allowlist top-level ключей → default-deny его отбрасывал).
- **§221 — backup не сохранял `channels` (модель роутинга §125).** Зеркальная
  асимметрия к masque_account: ключ был в allowlist restore, но забыт в
  backup-экспорте → при переносе на новое устройство **вся конфигурация
  роутинг-каналов** (vpn-1..vpn-10, фильтры, балансировщики) терялась. Также
  восстановлены в экспорте `channels_migrated`, `route_idle_suspend` (§215),
  `profiler_retention_sec` (§044). Добавлен тест-инвариант allowlist ⊆ export
  против будущих забытых ключей. Плюс добор §219-FIX4: `tolerance`/`poolTolerance`
  канала клэмпятся в снапшоте редактора (как `pool`).
- **§221 — use-after-dispose закрыт радикально.** §219 гейтил `_disposed` лишь
  в 2 точках home_controller; `_emit` оставался без гейта → start/stop/reconnect/
  switchNode/pullToRefresh могли `notifyListeners after dispose`. Одна проверка
  в `_emit` закрывает весь класс.
- **§221 — утечка `http.Client` в support-message** (главный экран) — тот же
  паттерн, что §219 закрыл в подписках/community, но прод-путь был пропущен.
- **§219 — CI:** `run_mode=release` требует HEAD на теге (иначе мусорная версия);
  убран `eval` из точечного прогона тестов.

### Changed

- **§219 — правило «UI-строки только английские»:** русский текст в user-facing
  выводе 6 shell-скриптов → английский.
- **§219 — производительность:** устранены повторные RegExp-компиляции (фильтры
  каналов, sanitize UA, MASQUE-ключи, разбор комментов подписки) и повторные
  пересчёты в `build()` (overview/routing/DNS-экраны); DNS-ответы профайлера — за
  один проход.
- **§130 — дефолтные эмодзи** для MASQUE-нод (🎭) и WARP (🔥🎭); палитра эмодзи-пикера.
- **Ядро `v1.14.0-lx.2`** (correctness-пасс, device-verified): MASQUE (h2) —
  зависший CONNECT больше не клинит outbound навсегда (handshake ограничен
  dial-контекстом); AmneziaWG — guard-suspended endpoint не воскрешается дозвоном;
  + гонка XHTTP-ридера, DNS-события на cache-hit, `GetPool` для nested-групп,
  AmneziaWG `s4`-MTU. Без новых фич и config-изменений.

### Removed

- **§219 — мёртвый код:** неиспользуемая зависимость `crypto`; write-only поле
  `VmessSpec.packetEncoding`; неиспользуемый `getDnsRules()`; фикстуры старого
  Clash API (69 КБ) и `widget_test.dart`-заглушка; видимый юзеру чип «Clash API»
  → «CommandClient».

### Docs

- **§219 — синхронизация с кодом:** Debug API (`help.dart` JSON + reference.md:
  удалён несуществующий `/settings/excluded_nodes`, добавлены реальные эндпоинты);
  ARCHITECTURE.md (services/native дерево, 5 CC-стримов); устаревшие ссылки на
  Clash API/ClashApiClient в комментариях; неточные докстринги профайлера/билдера.
- **§219 — отчёт аудита:** [`docs/spec/tasks/219-deep-audit-2026-07.md`](docs/spec/tasks/219-deep-audit-2026-07.md).

---

## [2.9.0] — 2026-07-02

**MASQUE-транспорт для WARP** — флагман релиза. Cloudflare WARP теперь можно
поднять не только по WireGuard, но и по **MASQUE (CONNECT-IP поверх HTTP/3/QUIC
и HTTP/2)**: другой пул выходных нод (чаще иностранные IP) и маскировка под
обычный HTTPS/QUIC к Cloudflare. В визарде Get WARP — переключатель транспорта,
выбор h3/h2, SNI-комбобокс и тюнинг idle-timeout/keep-alive. Ядро — стабильное
**v1.14.0-lx.1** (первый полный релиз ветки 1.14-lx). Плюс мелкие фиксы Debug API.

### Added

- **§130 — MASQUE-транспорт для Cloudflare WARP** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/130F-masque-warp-transport/spec.md), [masque_keys.dart](app/lib/services/warp/masque_keys.dart) · [masque_account.dart](app/lib/services/warp/masque_account.dart) · [warp_wizard_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/warp_wizard_screen.dart)). WARP — это сервис Cloudflare, а **транспорт** к нему теперь на выбор: привычный **WireGuard** или новый **MASQUE** (CONNECT-IP / RFC 9484 поверх QUIC-HTTP/3, с fallback на HTTP/2 там, где режут UDP). MASQUE даёт другой набор выходных нод (часто иностранные IP) и выглядит для DPI как обычный HTTPS к Cloudflare. Регистрация MASQUE-устройства идёт на телефоне (генерируется ECDSA P-256 keypair, приватник не покидает устройство; двухшаговый enroll в Cloudflare), ключи сериализуются в DER байт-в-байт под парсер ядра. В визарде **Get WARP** — переключатель **WireGuard ↔ MASQUE**; для MASQUE доступны: **Transport** (HTTP/3 QUIC / HTTP/2 TCP), **SNI** (combo-box из пула легитимных доменов + свободный ввод + кубик, по умолчанию — случайный домен), **Idle timeout** и **Keep-alive**. Ключевой материал MASQUE кешируется отдельно от WireGuard-аккаунта и попадает в бэкап.

### Changed

- **Ядро sing-box-lx → v1.14.0-lx.1** ([libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version), [docs/KERNEL.md](docs/KERNEL.md)). Первый полный стабильный релиз ветки 1.14-lx (после серии rc). Добавлен MASQUE CONNECT-IP outbound (SPEC 021, `type: masque`, профиль cloudflare, транспорты h3/h2) — ядровая половина §130.

### Fixed

- **§218 — Debug API `/help` синхронизирован с реальными роутами** ([help.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/help.dart)). Самодокументация `/help` разошлась с фактически смонтированными хендлерами (часть роутов не отражалась). Карта приведена в соответствие с `server.dart`.

- **`/help?format=json` больше не падает** ([help.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/help.dart), [help_json_test.dart](app/test/services/debug/help_json_test.dart)). Секция `errors.codes` имела целочисленные ключи (HTTP-код → описание), а `JsonEncoder` требует строковые — сериализация роняла весь ответ, соединение обрывалось (`format=text` при этом работал). Ключи приведены к строкам; тест проверяет сериализацию и что все вложенные Map имеют строковые ключи.

---

## [2.8.2] — 2026-07-01

Подписка **из локального файла**: список нод в файле теперь работает как обычная
подписка — живёт из кэша, показывается в списке, не слетает при авто-обновлении.
Плюс **редактируемый источник** подписки (сменить URL или переключить online↔file
без пересоздания). Исправлен краш конфига из-за одного битого XHTTP-параметра.
idle-suspend теперь включён по умолчанию. Ядро — rc.20.

### Added

- **§129 — Подписка из файла + редактируемый источник** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/129F-file-subscription/spec.md), [subscription_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/subscription_controller.dart) + [entry_context_menu.dart](app/lib/screens/subscriptions_screen/entry_context_menu.dart)). **Import from file…** с файлом, где **больше одной** ноды, создаёт **файловую подписку**: тело файла сохраняется снапшотом в кэш подписок, подписка живёт из него как обычная (re-hydrate при старте, бейдж **file** в списке). Файл с одной нодой — старое поведение (одиночный сервер). Ноды берутся из файла тем же парсером, что и онлайн-подписка: списки `vless://`/`vmess://`/…, base64, clash-yaml, JSON-outbounds, **WireGuard/AmneziaWG-конфиг** (`[Interface]`), плюс `#profile-title:`-заголовки. Авто-обновление файловую **не читает** (доступ к файлу между сессиями не хранится) → она не слетает при массовом апдейте онлайн-подписок; ноды остаются из кэша. Новый пункт **Edit source…** (long-press на подписке) — попап со сменой источника: **Online URL** (текстовое поле) ↔ **Local file** (выбор файла). Закрывает и давнюю просьбу — **редактируемый URL** подписки (сменился домен провайдера / опечатка) без пересоздания и потери настроек (`id` стабилен). Смена источника **транзакционна**: старый источник сбрасывается **только после успешной загрузки нового** (> 0 нод) — если новый URL/файл не отдал ноды, всё откатывается, подписка остаётся на прежнем источнике (не остаться без нод). +7 тестов.

### Changed

- **§128 — idle-suspend включён по умолчанию (30 s)** ([settings_storage/network.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage/network.dart)). Настройка **«Suspend idle tunnels»** (VPN Settings → System → Optimization) теперь по умолчанию `30 seconds`, а не Off — экономия памяти/CPU/батареи при многих WireGuard-нодах работает из коробки. Выключить: выбрать **Off**.

- **Ядро sing-box-lx → rc.20** ([libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version), [docs/KERNEL.md](docs/KERNEL.md)). rc.18 → rc.20: XHTTP `uplink_http_method=GET` вне packet-up теперь мягкий fallback на POST в самом ядре (страховка к §217), udpnat2 buffer fix, upstream sync. idle-suspend запечён в мобильный AAR (`with_lx_idle_suspend`). Ядровые детали и ловушки при бампе версии вынесены в **docs/KERNEL.md**.

### Fixed

- **§217 — Один битый XHTTP-параметр больше не роняет весь конфиг** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/217-xhttp-normalize-invalid-params.md), [transport_spec.dart](app/lib/models/transport_spec.dart)). Нода из подписки с `uplink_http_method=GET` (или header/cookie-placement) вне режима `packet-up` — недопустимое для ядра сочетание — валила **весь** конфиг на старте (`initialize outbound[N]: … can be GET only in packet-up mode` → туннель не поднимался). Теперь при сборке конфига такие параметры приводятся к безопасному дефолту (правила ядра `normalizeMeta` отзеркалены на клиенте), нода остаётся рабочей, а на самой ноде в подписке показывается **⚠️** и пишется предупреждение в лог. Крашивший класс сочетаний (GET-метод, невалидные placement/method) покрыт целиком.

- **§216 — heartbeat не пугает ложной «тишиной» после фона** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/216-heartbeat-resume-grace.md), [home_controller/heartbeat.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller/heartbeat.dart)). В фоне мониторинг туннеля приостанавливается (экономия батареи), поэтому при возврате в приложение первая проверка видела длинную «тишину» и писала пугающее `Heartbeat: silent 2905s` в DEBUG-лог, хотя туннель жив. Теперь первый тик после пробуждения не считается сбоем (даём потоку восстановиться), а в лог/на экран выводится осмысленное «Resumed — syncing tunnel…» (снек-бар только после долгого фона). Watchdog реального зависания ядра не затронут.

---

## [2.8.1] — 2026-07-01

Настройка энергосбережения **«Suspend idle tunnels»** (idle-suspend): ядро
усыпляет недостижимые WireGuard/AmneziaWG-туннели после простоя, освобождая
память и снижая нагрузку на CPU/батарею. Ядро обновлено до rc.18 (SPEC 020).

### Added

- **§128/§215 — Suspend idle tunnels** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/128F-idle-suspend/spec.md), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/215-libbox-rc18-idle-suspend.md), [settings_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart) + [build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart)). Новая настройка в **VPN Settings → System → Optimization**: порог простоя (Off / 30s / 2m / 5m), после которого ядро гасит (`device.Down()`) любой WG/AWG-эндпоинт, который одновременно **недостижим** из активного маршрута И **простаивает** дольше порога. Пробуждение — мгновенное, на следующем дайле. Прокидывается в `route.lx_idle_suspend` (пусто = выкл, kill-switch). Зачем: каждый живой WG-туннель держит recv-воркеры со своими буферами (~8 МБ/воркер при `BatchSize=128`), и GC постоянно их сканирует — при подписке с многими WG это главный держатель RAM и нагрева CPU, даже когда трафик идёт лишь через одну ноду. Device-verified на реальной подписке (11 WG): при включении освобождается **~134–155 МБ** буферов, а доля GC в CPU падает с ~56 % почти до нуля. Backend (storage/builder) и +2 теста.

### Changed

- **§215 — Ядро sing-box-lx → rc.18** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/215-libbox-rc18-idle-suspend.md), [libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version)). Бамп rc.16 → rc.18 (SPEC 020 «idle-suspend простаивающих WG/AWG эндпоинтов»). rc.18 понимает поле `route.lx_idle_suspend`; на старых ядрах конфиг с ним не грузился. CommandClient API не менялся.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-06-30

Поддержка XHTTP-нод (Xray splithttp) с полным набором параметров — теперь
расширенные xhttp-подписки (placement/obfs/tuning, в т.ч. через `extra`-JSON)
парсятся и работают. Плюс качество жизни: единый стартовый визард онбординга,
диалог-подтверждение при перехвате чужого VPN, открытие приложения долгим
нажатием на QS-плитку, и версия ядра в Debug API. Ядро обновлено до rc.16
(поля XHTTP SPEC 002 v2).

### Added

- **§127 — Полный XHTTP (Xray splithttp): все клиентские параметры из ссылки** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/127F-xhttp-full-url-params/spec.md), [transport_spec.dart](app/lib/models/transport_spec.dart) + [transport.dart](app/lib/services/parser/transport.dart)). Парсер ссылок `vless://…type=xhttp` расширен с 6 полей (v1, §097) до **полной клиентской поддержки SPEC 002 v2**: настраиваемые placement'ы session/seq/uplink (path/query/header/cookie), ключи, метод upload, **X-Padding obfs-режим** (`repeat-x`/`tokenish`), packet-up tuning (`sc_max_each_post_bytes`/`sc_min_posts_interval_ms`). Два источника полей в URL: плоские query-параметры **и** параметр `extra` (URL-encoded JSON) — `extra` декодируется и вливается в transport (битый/обрезанный `extra` игнорируется, ссылка остаётся рабочей на плоских параметрах). Ключи читаются в обеих формах: camelCase (Xray) и snake_case (sing-box); `path` с `?`-хвостом обрезается; числовые `sc*` приводятся к строке (`30.0` → `"30"`). При экспорте (`toUri`) пишутся только не-дефолтные поля — URI не раздувается, round-trip сохраняется. Верифицировано против ядра: `sing-box check -c` (`with_xhttp`) на выхлопе парсера из golden-ссылки → проходит; на реальной подписке xhttp-ноды поднимают коннект. +8 тестов + golden-fixture.

- **§126 — Стартовый визард первого запуска** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/126F-first-run-wizard/spec.md), [startup_wizard.dart](app/lib/screens/home/startup_wizard.dart)). Онбординг-промпты (разрешение на уведомления → battery optimization → добавить QS-плитку) сведены в **единый последовательный движок**: следующий шаг показывается только после закрытия предыдущего. Раньше они запускались параллельно и наезжали друг на друга. Добавлять/править/переупорядочивать онбординг-вопросы — в одном месте. Новый шаг — промпт «добавить плитку в быстрые настройки» (Android 13+); battery-промпт теперь показывается один раз.

- **§212 — Long-press на QS-плитке открывает приложение** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/212-tile-longpress-open-app.md), [AndroidManifest.xml](app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)). Долгое нажатие на плитку L×Box в шторке быстрых настроек открывает приложение (`QS_TILE_PREFERENCES` intent-filter). Короткий тап по-прежнему переключает VPN.

- **§213 — Debug API `/device` отдаёт версию ядра** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/213-debug-device-core-version.md), [device.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/device.dart)). `GET /device` теперь возвращает `core_version` (libbox / sing-box-lx, то что реально вкомпилировано в APK) рядом с `app_version`/`app_build` — первое, что нужно при разборе рассинхрона «парсер эмитит поле, которого ядро не знает».

### Changed

- **§211 — Подтверждение перед перехватом чужого VPN** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/211-foreign-vpn-switch-dialog.md), [home_dialogs.dart](app/lib/screens/home/home_dialogs.dart) + [VpnPlugin.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/VpnPlugin.kt)). При ручном старте из UI, если на устройстве уже активен VPN другого приложения, показывается диалог **«Another VPN is active — Switch?»**. Раньше наш старт молча отзывал чужой туннель (`VpnService.prepare()` возвращает `null` и когда чужого VPN нет, и когда он активен — код это не различал). Native определяет активный чужой VPN через `ConnectivityManager`/`TRANSPORT_VPN`. Только для UI-запуска; tile/automation/Debug API не трогаются. +3 теста.

- **§214 — ядро sing-box-lx → `v1.14.0-lx.1-rc.16`** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/214-libbox-rc16-xhttp-fields.md), [libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version)). Поля XHTTP SPEC 002 v2 (`sc_max_each_post_bytes`, `session_placement`, `x_padding_obfs_mode` и др.) добавлены в ядро. Без этого бампа расширенная xhttp-нода роняла **весь** конфиг на load (`unknown field`), а не только себя. CommandClient API не менялся.

---

## [2.7.0] — 2026-06-29

Балансировка нагрузки: auto-группа теперь умеет раскидывать соединения по пулу
серверов (round-robin со sticky-сессиями), а не только выбирать один быстрейший.
Плюс — глубокая on-device диагностика ядра: pprof-слепки (CPU/heap/goroutine) для
ловли нагрева и утечек, просмотр состава пула, и обвязка CommandClient, которая
работает в фоне. Ядро обновлено до rc.15 (фиксы балансировщика).

### Added

- **§208 — Load balance: round-robin балансировщик в auto-группе + просмотр пула** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/208-urltest-balancer-round-robin.md), [channel.dart](app/lib/models/channel.dart) + [channel_edit_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/channel_edit_screen.dart) + [build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart) + [pool_view_dialog.dart](app/lib/widgets/pool_view_dialog.dart)). Ядро (SPEC 019) ввело режим балансировки нагрузки на urltest-группах. Auto-двойник канала (`<tag>-auto`, §125) получил выбор **режима** в редакторе: **Fastest** (least_test — один лучший узел по latency, как было) ↔ **Load balance** (round_robin — раскидывает соединения по пулу из N узлов со sticky-привязкой сессий). Под Load balance: **Pool size**, **Pool tolerance** и горизонтально прокручиваемый ряд чипов **sticky-ключей** (process / domain / source ip / dest ip / dest port; пусто = чистая ротация без липкости). Tolerance гасится в Load balance (ядро его там игнорирует). Билдер дописывает `mode` + `balancer{pool, pool_tolerance, sticky_hash}` в config только при round_robin (least_test остаётся бит-в-бит апстримом). Long-press по auto-ноде round_robin-канала → пункт **«View pool»** → попап с текущим составом пула (фиксированные слоты `slot / нода / delay`) через новый RPC `GetPool`. Кламп `pool ≥ 1`, `pool_tolerance` uint16 (§161); старый канал без новых полей → дефолты (обратная совместимость). Device-verified: трафик размазывается по слотам пула равномерно (с дефолтным sticky `process+domain`). +26 тестов.

- **§207 — захват pprof-профилей на устройстве (goroutine / CPU / heap / allocs)** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/207-goroutine-cpu-dump.md), [PProfClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/PProfClient.kt) + [pprof_profile.dart](app/lib/vpn/pprof_profile.dart) + [box_vpn_client.dart](app/lib/vpn/box_vpn_client.dart) + [profile_dump_writer.dart](app/lib/services/profile_dump_writer.dart) + [diagnostics_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/app_settings_screen/widgets/diagnostics_tab.dart) + [diag.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/diag.dart)). Раздел **Profiling** в App Settings → Diagnostics: кнопки снимают pprof-слепки с живого ядра sing-box и открывают системный Share. Набор (источник правды — `PprofProfile.all`, один список гонит и кнопки, и native-вызов, и имя файла): **Goroutines (summary)** `goroutine?debug=1` (агрегированные счётчики — сколько горутин, что растёт), **Goroutines (full stacks)** `goroutine?debug=2` (полные стеки), **CPU profile (10s)** `profile?seconds=10`, **Heap (inuse_space)** `heap?gc=1` (`gc=1` форсит GC перед снимком → только реально живой объём), **Allocations** `allocs`. Цель — диагностика нагрева/100 % CPU и утечек памяти: CPU-профиль ловит busy-spin в tight-loop, heap/allocs показывают что удерживает/аллоцирует память, goroutine — стеки/утечку горутин (раньше был только **счётчик** `goroutines`, без трасс). Реализовано целиком на стороне оболочки через встроенный в libbox `PProfServer` (Go `net/http/pprof`) — **ядро не правилось**: сервер поднимается по тапу на loopback-порту (первый свободный из 6060..6065), отдаёт один GET, гасится в `finally` (в проде http-listener не висит). Контракт: Dart шлёт готовый `pathAndQuery`, Kotlin проверяет имя профиля по allowlist'у и проксирует; формат файла по дескриптору (`goroutine?debug=*` → `.txt`, остальные → бинарный `.pb` под `go tool pprof`, т.к. pprof не парсит debug-текст). Обобщённый Debug API `GET /diag/pprof?profile=P&query=Q`. На Debug-экране две прежние capture-кнопки свёрнуты в существующий переход «Diagnostics settings» → раздел Profiling (без дублирования). Гейт на активный VPN + re-entrancy guard. Грабля: Android API 28+ режет cleartext HTTP даже на 127.0.0.1 → `network_security_config.xml` разрешает cleartext **только для loopback**. Device-verified (CPH2411): `/diag/pprof?profile=heap` → HTTP 200, gzip pprof `.pb`; goroutine summary → total 221. +тесты.

- **§208/§209 — Debug API `GET /pool`** ([pool.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/pool.dart)). Read-only снапшот пула round_robin-группы для отладки балансировщика без UI: `GET /pool?tag=vpn-1-auto` → `{tag, count, slots:[{slot, tag, delay, alive}]}`. Не-round_robin группа → `200 slots:[]` (пул пуст); туннель down / клиент недоступен → `409 Conflict` (явная ошибка, не пустой ответ). Зеркалит UI «View pool».

### Changed

- **§209 — unary CC-методы через незасыпающий pingClient** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/209-unary-cc-via-pingclient.md), [BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt) + [cc_channel.dart](app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart)). Все unary RPC ядра (`getPool` / `getGroups` / `getRules` / `selectOutbound` / `closeConnection`) переведены с `anyClient()` (status/screen/profiler — паркуются в фоне по энергомодели §164) на **`pingClient`** — единственный lifecycle-независимый клиент. Следствие: `/pool`, «View pool» и прочие снапшоты теперь работают **и когда приложение свёрнуто** (туннель up), а не отдают пустоту. Контракт ошибки: при недоступном клиенте unary-снапшот возвращает `null` (→ `/pool` отдаёт 409, попап «Pool unavailable»), а не молчаливый пустой список — раньше «нет клиента» было неотличимо от «нет данных». Заодно `selectOutbound`/`close*` перестали врать `true` при отсутствии клиента. +5 тестов.

- **§210 — ядро sing-box-lx → `v1.14.0-lx.1-rc.15`** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/210-libbox-rc15-sticky-none.md), [build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart)). Фиксы балансировщика: sticky-ключ `domain` больше не теряется (роутер перезаписывал destination до балансировщика → весь трафик схлопывался в один узел — на rc.14 был перекос), слоты пула не сдвигаются при health-check, выключение липкости теперь через явный sentinel `["none"]`. Наш билдер под новый контракт: пустой набор sticky-чипов эмитит `sticky_hash:["none"]`, а не `[]` (ядро ре-маршалит конфиг и схлопывает `[]`→nil = «дефолт», поэтому `[]` липкость не выключал). javap: CommandClient API не менялся.

- **§NNN из видимых снаружи строк** ([help.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/help.dart) и др.). Номера задач (`§NNN`) убраны из строк, которые видит пользователь/агент: `/help` Debug API, тексты ошибок, UI-подписи, лог-сообщения — теперь самодостаточны. В `//`-комментариях кода `§NNN` остаются (конвенция проекта).

## [2.6.2] — 2026-06-28

Патч к v2.6.1 — новое ядро (фикс холодного Auto), унификация вкладки Conns с
профайлером, читаемость баннеров в обеих темах.

### Changed

- **§204 — вкладка Conns в стиле профайлера (routing)** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/204-conns-routing-unify-with-profiler.md), [cc_channel.dart](app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart) + [routing_section.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen/routing_section.dart) + [connection_detail_sheet.dart](app/lib/screens/connections_screen/connection_detail_sheet.dart)). Ряд соединения: две строки (outbound + `NETWORK · rule · duration`) → одна routing-строка §181 (`rule ⇒ группы : node → detour → dest`), таймер вынесен фиксированно вправо. Окно детализации: Routing-секция теперь 1:1 с профайлером — **Route + Rule + Chain + Detour + Outbound + Outbound type** (раньше Conns не показывал Chain/Detour, хотя данные были; профайлер не показывал Outbound type). `CcConnection.routingLineOf` идентичен `TrafficEvent.routingLineOf` (один источник цепочек из ядра, 9 golden-тестов).

- **§206 — DNS final по умолчанию → cloudflare_udp + единая палитра баннеров** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/206-dns-final-default-cloudflare.md), [banner_palette.dart](app/lib/widgets/banner_palette.dart) + [wizard_template.json](app/assets/wizard_template.json)). Дефолт `dns_final` сменён на `cloudflare_udp`. Warning-баннеры (LocalResolver, resolver-picker, stats) приведены к единой `BannerPalette` — жёлтый текст больше не нечитаем (был белый на светлом amber в тёмной теме / бледный в светлой); warning-текст в светлой теме = контрастный коричневый.

- **§205 — ядро sing-box-lx → `v1.14.0-lx.1-rc.12`** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/205-libbox-rc12-cold-urltest.md)). Фикс холодного `urltest.Now()` (SPEC 019): на старте Auto-группа сразу сообщает реально набираемый сервер (`Select(tcp/udp)`-fallback) вместо пустого значения. Теперь строка «Auto» на главной показывает `→ сервер` сразу после подключения, цепочка в профайлере доходит до узла, «Select server» (§203) работает с холодной. API CommandClient без изменений — Dart/Kotlin не трогались.

## [2.6.1] — 2026-06-28

Патч к v2.6.0 — мелкие доводки главного экрана.

### Fixed

- **§203 (часть A) — пинг уезжал в середину строки** ([node_row.dart](app/lib/widgets/node_row.dart)). Регресс §199: в обычной ноде (без выбранного urltest-сервера) лейбл транспорта и распорка делили остаток ширины поровну → значение пинга (`425MS`) всплывало в середину строки вместо правого края. Левая часть строки (ACTIVE / сервер / транспорт) теперь живёт в одном `Expanded`, пинг всегда прижат к правому краю. Приоритет сервера из §199 сохранён.

### Added

- **§203 (часть B) — «Select server» в меню auto-ноды** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/203-select-server-on-auto.md), [node_row.dart](app/lib/widgets/node_row.dart) + [node_list.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/node_list.dart) + [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). Long-press по auto-ноде → пункт **Select server** (виден только когда у группы есть текущий выбор `→ <нода>`): подсвечивает сервер, который urltest выбрал быстрейшим, и скроллит к нему в списке (best-effort `Scrollable.ensureVisible`). Канал не переключает — auto продолжает авто-выбор.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-06-28

Настраиваемые каналы роутинга (§125): каналы переехали из статичного шаблона в
storage и стали полноценными CRUD-объектами — своё имя, regex node-filter (с
инверсией), default-regex, персональный auto-двойник (urltest) и галки
`direct`/`block`/`interrupt`. Вокруг — серия UX-доводок главного экрана и
роутинга (§195–202): сохранение фильтра с главной в канал, пин активной ноды,
block-outbound с защитой от бессмысленного пинга, и лечение висячих ссылок на
выключенный канал прямо в storage.

### Added

- **§125 — настраиваемые каналы (configurable channels)** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/125F-configurable-channels/), [channel.dart](app/lib/models/channel.dart) + [channels.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage/channels.dart) + [channel_edit_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/channel_edit_screen.dart)). Каналы роутинга (`vpn-1..vpn-4` + `✨auto`) были статичны: юзер мог только включить/выключить их тоглом. Теперь — полноценно настраиваемые объекты с CRUD. Каналы переехали из `wizard_template.json` (`preset_groups[]`) в storage (`channels[]`); template стал seed'ом на первый запуск (one-shot миграция `enabled_groups[]` → `channels[]`). Возможности:
  - **CRUD** — создавать (до 10 каналов) и удалять (кроме `vpn-1`). Удаление переводит ссылки на удалённый канал (`route_final` / custom-rule outbound) на `vpn-1`.
  - **Title** — менять отображаемое имя канала («Моя Германия» вместо «vpn-1»); видно в home-dropdown и роутинг-пикерах.
  - **Galки селектора** — `include direct-out`, `include block` (§201), `interrupt connections on switch`.
  - **Regex node-filter** — одна regex по итоговому tag ноды (как §048 на главной); в канал попадают только matched-ноды. Снимает прежнее «все selector делят один набор нод». Пусто/невалидно → все ноды. Инверсия (`!`-тогл, §197) — исключающий фильтр.
  - **Default-regex** — первая matched нода становится `options.default`.
  - **Auto-двойник** — галка `include auto` генерирует парный urltest `<tag>-auto` (ноды канала, без direct/auto) с настраиваемыми url/interval/tolerance/idle/interrupt. Глобальный `✨auto` больше не отдельный канал — у каждого канала свой двойник.
  - Полноэкранный редактор канала (back-guard Save/Keep/Discard) с live-превью regex (matched N/total + выбранная default-нода).

- **§195 — Сохранить regex-фильтр с главной в активный канал** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/195-save-home-filter-to-channel.md), [node_list.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/node_list.dart) + [filter_widgets.dart](app/lib/screens/home/filter_widgets.dart)). В regex-поле фильтра на главной справа от `×` — кнопка 💾 (видна при непустом валидном паттерне + наличии активного канала). Клик → диалог «Channel filter / Default» → открывается редактор канала с предзаполненным полем (явное сохранение, не тихое), юзер видит куда легло значение и сохраняет через Save. Инверсия фильтра (§197) переносится вместе с паттерном. Мост §048-песочница → §125-канал.

- **§196 — Активная нода пинится вверху после direct/auto** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/196-active-node-pinned-after-direct-auto.md), [home_state.dart](app/lib/models/home_state.dart)). Текущая выбранная нода группы закрепляется в списке сразу после direct/auto при ЛЮБОЙ сортировке (не за тоглом) — всегда на виду.

- **§197 — Инверсия node_filter канала** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/197-channel-node-filter-invert.md), [channel.dart](app/lib/models/channel.dart) + [channel_edit_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/channel_edit_screen.dart)). `!`-тогл (как в §048-фильтре) слева от поля node-filter в редакторе канала: инвертирует смысл — в канал попадают ноды, чей tag НЕ матчит regex (исключающий фильтр, напр. «всё КРОМЕ bypass»). Отдельный bool `node_filter_invert`. Пустой фильтр → инверсия игнорируется. Только для node_filter (default_filter без инверсии).

- **§198 — Имена каналов с цифрой-в-кружке** ([channel_edit_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/channel_edit_screen.dart) + [wizard_template.json](app/assets/wizard_template.json)). Seed-имена каналов из template укорочены до 2 строк (компактный редактор), дефолтные label получают цифру-в-кружке (①②③④) вместо «vpn-N».

- **§199 — Приоритет сервера в строке auto** ([node_row.dart](app/lib/widgets/node_row.dart)). В строке auto/urltest-ноды на главной выбранный сервер (`→ <нода>`) важнее транспорта: транспорт обрезается первым при нехватке места, сервер виден всегда.

- **§200 — Warning: фильтр канала отсёк все ноды** ([build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart)). Когда per-channel node_filter (с учётом инверсии) не пропустил ни одной ноды И в подписке ноды были — билдер добавляет в баннер конфига предупреждение «Channel "X" (vpn-N): node filter matched no nodes — traffic is blocked (default), or use direct». Не варнит при пустом фильтре или пустой подписке.

- **§201 — Block-outbound для каналов** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/201-block-outbound-for-channels.md), [build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart) + [channel_edit_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/channel_edit_screen.dart)). Добавлен системный block-outbound `{type: block, tag: block}` (дроп трафика; ядро rc.10 поддерживает) по образцу `direct-out`. Галка «Include block» в редакторе канала добавляет block опцией селектора. В route-final пикере block всегда доступен (последним в списке) и покрашен красным (как reject в правилах). На главной block показывается с иконкой `Icons.block`, закреплён вверху, **не пингуется** (urltest для block всегда вернул бы ERR — пункт Ping выключен, delay-бейдж скрыт, из mass-ping исключён). **Fallback пустого канала** (фильтр отсёк всё) теперь = `[block, direct-out]` с `default: block` — безопаснее блокировать, чем выпускать трафик мимо VPN; direct остаётся доступной опцией.

### Fixed

- **§202 — dangling channel-ссылки лечатся в storage при выключении канала** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/202-heal-channel-refs-on-disable.md), [channels.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage/channels.dart)). Если `route_final` или custom-rule `outbound` указывали на канал, который затем **выключили** (не удалили), деградировал только выхлоп билдера (→ vpn-1 при сборке), а в storage ссылка оставалась висеть на выключенном теге — приходилось вручную пересохранять правило. Теперь переход канала `enabled: true → false` чинит storage немедленно (как при удалении, §125 F4.5): висячие ссылки → `vpn-1`. Необратимо — повторное включение не воскрешает старую ссылку. detour-ссылки по-прежнему деградирует билдер (§172).

## [2.5.2] — 2026-06-27

VPN-настройки приведены к единому источнику истины (JSON), TUN-зависимые тумблеры
переехали в Mode-вкладку, исправлен баг прерывания чужого VPN в proxy-режиме,
починена пропажа соединений на Stats со временем, разведены счётчики соединений,
выпилен мёртвый Clash-рудимент.

### Fixed

- **§193 — Stats со временем терял список соединений** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/193-connections-reemit-on-subscribe.md), BoxCommandClient.kt + VpnPlugin.kt + home_controller.dart). Туннель жив, главный экран показывал соединения, но вкладка Stats — 0 («No active connections»). Корень: connections от ядра — single-shot reset-снапшот при подписке (pull `getConnections` в libbox нет, в отличие от `getGroups`); при повторном открытии Stats screenClient не пересоздаётся (refcount>0) → нового снапшота нет. Усугублял §185 `resyncForReopen`, зовущийся на каждый `connected` (рвал connections на реконнектах). Фикс: (1) re-emit накопленного аккумулятора новому подписчику в `onListen` connections-канала; (2) `resyncForReopen` гейтнут до реального cold-start (флаг `_didColdStartResync`), не на каждый реконнект. Device-verified.
- **§192 — proxy-режим рвал чужой активный VpnService** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/192-proxy-mode-prepare-revokes-foreign-vpn.md), BootReceiver.kt + 6 точек запуска). В режиме `proxy` (port-only, без TUN) запуск нашего сервиса отзывал (`onRevoke`) активный VPN другого приложения. Корень: `VpnService.prepare()` (а НЕ `establish()`) забирает системный VPN-слот — Android делает наше приложение «prepared VPN package» уже на consent, и `prepare()` вызывался безусловно на всех 6 точках входа без учёта режима. Фикс: `has_tun` (производное от vpn_mode) зеркалится в native; `prepare()` гейтится за ним — в proxy-режиме не вызывается, чужой VPN не трогается. Точки: `VpnPlugin.startVpn`/`startVpnHeadless`, `MainActivity.startVpnWithConsent`, `LxBoxIntentReceiver`, `LxBoxTileService`, `LocaleSettingReceiver`. Default `has_tun=true` — vpn-режим и старые юзеры не задеты. Device-verified.

### Changed

- **§189 — native_prefs: настройки с единым источником истины (JSON)** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/189-native-prefs-mirror-in-json.md), [native_prefs.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage/native_prefs.dart)). Шесть Android-настроек (`auto_start`, `keep_on_exit`, `background_mode`, `core_logs_enabled`, `allow_bypass`, `auto_redirect`) раньше жили ТОЛЬКО в native SharedPreferences (`boxvpn_boot.*`) — непрозрачно для бэкапа/импорта/UI. Теперь модель: `lxbox_settings.json` = источник истины (диск), native = рабочая копия (оперативка) для Dart-less моментов (BOOT_COMPLETED, swipe, establish — когда Flutter недоступен). Секция `native_prefs` в JSON; write-through (set пишет в JSON → зеркалит в native); на старте sync JSON⇒native (само чинится при расхождении). Все писатели (UI/импорт/Debug API) идут через единую дверь `SettingsStorage.setNativeBool`. Единая backup-сериализация (`exportNativePrefsBackup`/`applyNativePrefsBackup`) — устранён тройной дубль (backup_service + Debug-handler). Доделана Dart-обёртка `auto_redirect` (§124). Device-verified (Debug API: write-through, 6 ключей, bootstrap).
- **§188 — keep-alive + allow-bypass переехали в Mode-вкладку** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/188-tun-toggles-to-mode-tab.md), [vpn_mode_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/vpn_mode_tab.dart)). Тумблеры «Keep VPN on exit» и «Allow VPN bypass» — TUN-зависимые (работают вокруг VpnService/Builder, бессмысленны в proxy-режиме) — переехали из App Settings в VPN Settings → Mode, группа «Tunnel options». Видны только при наличии TUN (режимы VPN / VPN+Proxy), скрыты в Proxy. `keep_on_exit` дефолт изменён `false→true` (keep-alive ожидаем). `interrupt_on_switch` (режим-независим) остался в App Settings. Device-verified.
- **§194 — ясность счётчиков соединений** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/194-connection-counters-clarity.md), [traffic_bar.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/traffic_bar.dart)). Три экрана показывали разные числа соединений (главный «13», Stats «6», Conns своё) — юзер не понимал кому верить. Корень: главный складывал `connectionsIn + connectionsOut`, а это два РАЗНЫХ множества ядра — `connectionsIn` (трафик-трекер = соединения приложений, как на Stats) + `connectionsOut` (route-менеджер = физические соединения к серверам). Теперь главный показывает РАЗДЕЛЬНО: 🔗 (приложений, совпадает со Stats) + 🗄 (серверов), long-press → tooltip. Conns заголовок: «N active / M total». Device-verified.

### Removed

- **§191 — Clash API из VPN Settings → Core** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/191-remove-clash-api-from-core.md), wizard_template.json). Удалена секция «Clash API» (Address + Secret) — мёртвый рудимент после §122 (ядро без `with_clash_api`, билдер не инжектил clash с rc.3). Device-verified.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-06-27

Хотфикс к v2.5.0 — регрессия lifecycle при swipe-from-recents с keep-alive туннелем. После «смахивания» приложения из недавних процесс выживал (foreground VPN-сервис), умирал только Flutter-движок; при повторном открытии все CommandClient-клиенты оставались привязаны к мёртвому движку → UI `Connected`, но пустой (статус-broadcast горел, данные не текли). Cold-start теперь пере-синхронизирует все каналы данных с ядром.

### Fixed

- **§185 — cold-start не пере-синхронизировал CommandClient** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/185-cold-start-cc-resync.md), [BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart)). После swipe-reopen: `Connected`, но Channel/Nodes пусты, Stats — спиннер, скорость ↑↓ висит; лечилось только перезапуском VPN. Корень: все 4 CC-клиента (поля на companion `BoxService`) переживали swipe, но привязаны к sink'ам мёртвого Flutter-движка. Новый `resyncForReopen()` на cold-start: сброс протухшего `screenRefs`=0 + close осиротевшего screenClient (→ `connectScreen` переподнимет на свежие sink'и) + форс `connectStatus()` на NORMAL для statusClient (минуя ранний return `setStatusFast`) + disconnect осиротевших profiler/ping-клиентов. Зовётся из `_startCcStreams` (async) перед `connectScreen`. Замок A (Dart-триггер) уже был закрыт — `init` пуллит `connected` как переход. Device-verified (vc=2876): swipe-reopen не воспроизводит ни пустой UI, ни подвисание Stats.
- **§187 — таймер соединения сбрасывался на swipe-reopen** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/187-uptime-survives-swipe.md), [BoxVpnService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxVpnService.kt)). `connectedSince` ставился в `now()` на каждый `connected`-event; на cold-start `connected` приходит pull'ом → время старта терялось. Native companion `tunnelStartedElapsedMs` (`SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()`, монотонные часы, переживает swipe) + handler `getTunnelUptimeMs` → Dart `_syncUptimeFromNative` на cold-start корректирует `connectedSince = now - uptime` (свежий старт uptime≈0 → без регресса).

### Changed

- **§186 — локальная сборка пинит versionCode к релизному тегу** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/186-local-build-vc-pin-to-tag.md), [build-local-apk.sh](scripts/build-local-apk.sh)). `build-local-apk.sh` брал `build-number = git rev-list --count HEAD` → на ветке разработки локальный vc обгонял релизный (HEAD-count > tag-count) → релиз с GitHub не ставился поверх локальной сборки (downgrade-блок). Теперь пин к `count(<last-vN.N.N-tag>)` → локальный arm64 vc = ровно релизный → `install -r` в обе стороны. Множитель `+2000` (arm64) добавляет сам Flutter при `--split-per-abi` — одинаков для CI и локалки, не источник расхождения. Fallback без тега: `0.0.0+<HEAD-count>`.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-06-27

Миграция на ядро sing-box-lx `v1.14.0-lx.1` и полный отказ от Clash API. Управляющий канал UI переведён с Clash HTTP на libbox `CommandClient` (server-stream push вместо Timer-polling): статус, группы, соединения и URLTest теперь идут напрямую из ядра. Kotlin-обвязка адаптирована под breaking-изменения libbox 1.14 (Tailscale/SSH-сервер влил новые обязательные методы PlatformInterface/CommandServerHandler). Добавлена энергомодель CC-клиентов (адаптивная частота + сон в фоне). Профайлер и имена правил переведены на новый канал. Закрыт критический баг REALITY-валидации, ронявший весь конфиг от одной битой ноды.

#### Выводы по миграции (оценка 2026-06-26)

1. **Энергопотребление снизилось.** Главный выигрыш — фон: старый heartbeat-поллер (`Timer.periodic(20с)` → loopback-HTTP + парсинг всего `/connections`) был always-on и не паузился; теперь `onAppPaused` гасит status+screen клиентов — **0 тиков/0 drain в фоне** (было always-on). На переднем плане тики чаще (2/с NORMAL vs ~0.05/с polling), но каждый радикально дешевле (внутрипроцессный gRPC+дельты vs HTTP+полный JSON), UI-ребилд троттлится до 1с, FAST 0.1с физически невозможен в фоне (только при открытом Stats). Чистый баланс — меньше.
2. **Миграцию НЕ откатывать — это необходимый долгосрочный шаг.** Четыре самостоятельных довода: безопасность (старый Clash открывал TCP-порт на `127.0.0.1`, доступный любому приложению устройства — теперь порт не открывается вовсе), доступ к ядру 1.14 (WG-GRO §010, anti-DPI Hysteria2), чистота архитектуры (4 поллера → 1 push-стрим, −~1000 строк pull-diff, типизированный контракт), новые возможности (per-app профайлер, closed-история, +9 Debug-роутов). Стоимость отката высокая и тянет назад также §010/§169/§172 + возвращает секьюрити-дыру.
3. **Системный долг #1 (ядро): гонка map обойдена, не починена.** §170 (SIGABRT `concurrent map iteration and map write` в `libbox.Connections.ApplyEvents`, `command_types.go`) решён клиент-стороной (по-клиентный аккумулятор), но **мьютекса в ядре нет** — третий потребитель `CommandConnections` вернёт краш. Долг ядра задокументирован: `sing-box-lx/SPECS/016-CONNECTIONS_MAP_MUTEX/SPEC.md`.
4. **Системный долг #2 (релиз-гейт): JNI-смоук на старом Android.** 11 fail-safe `CommandClientHandler`-колбэков (контракт JNI-no-throw §050/§151) не прогнаны на Android 10 — unchecked-исключение через JNI там = abort всего процесса. Смоук на старом API — гейт перед merge в `main`. Также: server-less AAR (`without with_clash_api`) держится на дисциплине, не на автоматике.

### Added

- **§122 — нативный канал `BoxCommandClient` на libbox CommandClient** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/122F-commandclient-migration/spec.md)). Три CommandClient'а с разной ролью: `statusClient` (always-on), `screenClient` (per-screen, ref-counted), `profilerClient` (per-recording). 11 handler-колбэков каждый в fail-safe try/catch (контракт JNI-no-throw §050/§151). Нативный аккумулятор Connections (`applyEvents`/`filterState`/`getReset`), 4 троттлящих эмиттера (coalesce-снапшот + null-sink guard + main-Handler), императивы `urlTestOutbound`/`getRules`/`selectOutbound`/`closeConnection`, generation-gate + reconnect-backoff. ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [BoxVpnService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxVpnService.kt), [VpnPlugin.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/VpnPlugin.kt))
- **§122 — Dart-слой `cc_channel`** ([cc_channel.dart](app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart)). Push-стримы `status`/`outbounds`/`groups`/`connections` поверх EventChannel `lxbox/cc/*`; императивы `urlTestOutbound` (`CcDelayResult`, инвариант `error` vs `delay==0`), `getRules`, `selectOutbound`, `closeConnection`; lifecycle `connectScreen`/`connectProfiler`. Типизированные модели `CcStatus`/`CcOutbound`/`CcGroup`/`CcConnection`/`CcDelayResult`/`CcRule`.
- **§122 — unary-pull `getGroups` (ядро SPEC 015)** ([home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart), [cc_channel.dart](app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart)). Детерминированный lifeline там, где push дырявый: `getGroups(): List<CcGroup>?` (`null` = ядро не STARTED, `[]` = нет групп, непустой = снапшот); общий `serializeGroup` для push+pull → единый парсер `CcGroup.fromMap`. `_startGroupsPull` — retry 400мс×12 до STARTED.
- **§180 — DNS-журнал из ядра (`subscribeDNSQueries`, ядро SPEC 018, rc.7)** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/180-dns-query-stream.md), [BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [cc_channel.dart](app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart), [traffic_profiler.dart](app/lib/services/traffic_profiler.dart)). Профайлер перешёл с текстового парсинга core-лога (`_dnsRe`/`_handleDnsLine` + `_DnsAccumulator` по conn_id) на структурный стрим. Новый канал `lxbox/cc/dns`: `DnsQueryHandler.onQuery(DnsQuery)` → `CcDnsQuery{domain, queryType, rcode, source, failed, error, packageName, answers[]}` → `_ingestDnsQueries`. Три выигрыша: **атрибуция к приложению ИЗ ЯДРА** (`processInfo`, не сшивка по connId — бьёт корень §177-баннера); **cnameChain одним событием** (`answers[]` с type==CNAME, не построчная аккумуляция); **провалы структурно** (`failed`/`error`/`rcode=-1`). Грабли SPEC 018: `rcode` signed (`-1`=нет ответа, мапить до `.toUInt()`); событийный `EventEmitter` (НЕ coalesce — DNS-резолвы дискретны). Подписка на `profilerClient` (`includeAnswers=true`), `DnsQuerySubscription.close()` в teardown. Текстовый DNS-путь выпилен начисто (вариант A, fallback нет). 39 профайлер-тестов зелёных. **rc.10:** ядро добавило в `DnsQuery` поля `dnsServer`/`dnsServerType` (какой DNS-сервер резолвил — на всех путях, включая провалы) + `outbound()` (канал сервера, селектор развёрнут в активный узел server-side, пусто на cached). Клиент читает их (javap-сверка: имена `getDNSServer`/`getDNSServerType` с DNS заглавными, `outbound()` → `StringIterator` как chain/detour) → `CcDnsQuery.{dnsServer,dnsServerType,outbound}` → профайлер кладёт `outbound` в `outboundChain` (routingLine показывает «через какой сервер пошёл DNS»), сервер/тип — в detail-sheet (строка «DNS server»).
- **§044/new-profiler — редизайн профайлера: одна control-строка + фильтр-окно** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/044F-per-app-traffic-profiler/new-profiler.md)). Управление `TraceExplorer` свёрнуто с трёх рядов в одну строку (пауза · retention · группировка-меню · фильтр-окно); запись и export — в хедере. Live-вкладка переименована в **Profiler**. **Фильтр вынесен в окно** (`ProfilerFilterSheet`, паттерн `filter_panel` главного): 2 вкладки — **Protocol** (DNS/TCP/UDP чипы) и **App** (галочки замеченных в трафике пакетов + «потеряшки»/unattributed + кнопка пикера полного списка); жёлтый бейдж «фильтр выбран» + счётчик. `ProfilerFilter` (ChangeNotifier) — единая фильтр-модель, оси app/тип ортогональны. **Live retention настраиваемо** (было жёстко 60s): `SettingsStorage.profiler_retention_sec`, опции 1m/10m/1h, default 10мин, hard cap буфера 3000→20000. Export видимого списка событий (`eventsToJson`). Иконка фильтра на главном унифицирована (`tune`→`filter_list`). ([trace_explorer.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen/trace_explorer.dart), [profiler_filter.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen/profiler_filter.dart), [profiler_filter_sheet.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen/profiler_filter_sheet.dart))
- **§178 — detour-хвост в цепочке соединения** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/178-detour-tail-in-connection-chain.md), ядро SPEC 017). `Connection.detour()` (proto field 23) даёт физический хвост финального outbound (`node → WARP`) отдельно от роутинг-`chains`. Клиент читает `detours: List<String>`; профайлер несёт `detourChain` отдельной осью. Forward-compat: код готовился до выхода rc.6, активирован после javap-сверки `Connection.detour()` в AAR.
- **§181 — секция ROUTING: единая «цепочка решения»** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/181-routing-section-three-axes.md)). Плоский список из 4 элементов → человекочитаемая трассировка `routingLine`: `[tcp] процесс ⇒ rule ⇒ группа ⇒ auto : сервер → detour → domain · 930ms`. Разделители кодируют тип перехода (`⇒` внутри роутинга, `:` выход к серверу, `→` снаружи/detour). Оси `outboundChain` (маршрут) и `detourChain` (транспорт) разделены. detail-sheet: Route-строка + сырые Chain/Detour для копирования + явная строка Rule; раздел Process → **App** (иконка приложения + читаемое имя).
- **§164 — энергомодель CC-клиентов** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/164-cc-clients-energy-model.md), [feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/123F-subscription-model/spec.md)). Адаптивная частота `statusClient`: `NORMAL` 0.5с (главный экран) / `FAST` 0.1с (открыт Stats); смена интервала = пересоздание клиента (`setStatusInterval`), не live-mutation. Сон в фоне (`onAppPaused`): `pauseStatus`+`pauseScreen` обнуляют тики, `profilerClient` не паузится (recording живёт свёрнутым). Resume (`onAppResumed`) с ресинком, гейтится если туннель упал в фоне. VPN-off в фоне ловит нативный `BROADCAST_STATUS` (не CC) → сон не теряет видимость туннеля. Эффект: главный экран 2 тика/с (было 10), фон 0 (было 10). ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [VpnPlugin.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/VpnPlugin.kt))
- **§165 — справочник имён правил `RuleNameResolver`** ([rule_name_resolver.dart](app/lib/services/rule_name_resolver.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/165-rule-name-registry.md)). Ядро в `connection.rule` отдаёт условия без имени и обрезает списки >3 многоточием — парсить строку ненадёжно. Резолвер строит эталонные строки условий из `custom_rules` (где известны и `name`, и условия), матчит нормализованную `c.rule` через `indexOf` (обрезанная ядровая строка ⊂ полной) → title. Кэш `c.rule→title` (включая промахи) — без него фриз при `FAST` ×10/сек; сброс на stop VPN.
- **Debug API — 9 новых роутов + headless-старт** ([action.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/action.dart), [settings.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/settings.dart), [subs.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/subs.dart)). Action: `POST /action/reconnect`, `POST /action/reload-vpn`, `POST /action/clear-error`, `POST /action/urltest?cancel=1`. Settings (top-level ключи мимо `/settings/vars`): `GET|PUT /settings/interrupt_on_switch`, `/settings/node_sort`, `/settings/enabled_groups`, `/settings/vpn_mode`. Флаг `replace_detour_chain` в `PATCH /subs/{id}`. `POST /action/start-vpn-headless` — старт VPN без consent-диалога, если разрешение уже выдано (`VpnService.prepare()==null`); иначе `needs_consent:true`.
- **§030 — custom-правила: `source_ip_cidr` / `source_ip_is_private` / `inbound`** ([new_fields spec](docs/spec/tasks/030F-custom-routing-rules/new_fields.md), [custom_rule.dart](app/lib/models/custom_rule.dart), [custom_rules.dart](app/lib/services/builder/post_steps/custom_rules.dart)). Народ просил правила с inbound/source-полями (§030 закрывал как YAGNI). Контекст изменился: §119 дал два inbound'а (`tun-in`/`mixed-in`) → `inbound` стал осмысленным (отделить трафик локального прокси от VpnService); `source_ip_cidr` симметричен `ip_cidr` (фильтр по источнику). Сверено с ядром `v1.14.0-lx.1-rc.9` (`option/rule_set.go` + `rule.go`): `source_ip_cidr` → headless rule_set (1.14 принимает), `source_ip_is_private`/`inbound` → routing-rule level (headless их не имеет). Для srs — всё route-level (своего headless match нет). DNS-mirror (§117): `inbound`/`source_ip_cidr` прокидываются в dns-rule (1.14 принимает). UI: раскрывающаяся секция **INBOUND** (галочки `TUN — system interface`/`Proxy interface`, `mixed-in` гейтится по vpn_mode через `VpnModeConfig.hasMixed`); **Source IP CIDR** + `Private source IP` в секции MATCH. Debug API `/rules` (GET/POST/PATCH) подхватывает новые поля. Backward-compat: старые правила без полей → пусто.
- **§030 — кнопка `Presets ▾` в CIDR-полях** ([items_field.dart](app/lib/screens/custom_rule_edit/widgets/items_field.dart), [match_section.dart](app/lib/screens/custom_rule_edit/sections/match_section.dart)). Quick-вставки в `IP CIDR` / `Source IP CIDR` (append с новой строки, как Paste): **Localhost** (`127.0.0.0/8` + `::1/128`), **Wi-Fi subnet** (`192.168.0.0/16`), **All (IPv4 + IPv6)** (`0.0.0.0/0` + `::/0`). `Localhost`/`All` дают обе IP-семьи одной вставкой. `ItemsField` получил опциональный `presets`-параметр (`FieldPreset` + `showMenu`); кнопка рисуется только при непустом списке — domain/port-поля её не получают. Порядок action-row: `Paste · Presets · Clear`.
- **§182 — кнопки Stop / Reconnect в постоянном уведомлении** (фидбэк #180 llava, #261 iliyal; [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/182-notification-action-buttons.md)). Раньше в foreground-уведомлении была только кнопка-тап «открыть приложение» — теперь две action-кнопки прямо в шторке. **Stop** шлёт `ACTION_STOP` → `doStop()` (та же механика, что Stop в приложении). **Reconnect** — новый **native-side** примитив `BoxVpnService.reconnect()` (`ACTION_RECONNECT`): `stopAwait()` (дождаться полного `Stopped`) → `start()` на companion-level `reconnectScope`. Через `stopAwait`, а не «`doStop`+сразу `start`», — ранний старт попал бы в `onStartCommand` guard и молча провалился (тот же race, что §002 закрыл для Dart). Работает **с убитым UI-движком** (путь полностью native, не зависит от Flutter). Stop-фаза с `withTimeout(6с)` → abort при таймауте; `reconnecting`-guard от двойного тапа; кнопки шлют explicit broadcast (`setPackage`) на `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED`-ресивер → извне не дёрнуть. Dart-слой не менялся — UI пересинхронится по broadcast'у статуса. ([BoxVpnService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxVpnService.kt), [BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt), [ServiceNotification.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/ServiceNotification.kt))
- **§184 — четвёртый канал роутинга `vpn-4` (VPN ④)** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/184-add-vpn4-channel.md)). Добавлен 4-й selector-канал по образцу `vpn-3` (`default_enabled: false`, `default: direct-out`). Каналы динамические из `wizard_template.json` — основное изменение одна запись в `preset_groups[]` + `'vpn-4'` в `groupTags` (`node_filter_screen.dart`, иначе группа = фейк-нода). 1275 тестов зелёные.

### Changed

- **§121 — Kotlin-обвязка мигрирована на libbox 1.14 API** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/121F-libbox-1.14-adoption/spec.md)). `PlatformInterface` получил 11 новых обязательных методов (Tailscale/SSH-сервер, на Android не используются) как fail-safe no-throw заглушки: `registerMyInterface`, `usePlatformShell`→`false`, `lookupUser`→пустой `PlatformUser()`, `tailscaleHostname`→`""`, `openShellSession`→`UnsupportedOperationException`, `startNeighborMonitor`/`closeNeighborMonitor`→no-op и др. `CommandServerHandler` получил `connectSSHAgent()` и `triggerNativeCrash()`. ([PlatformInterfaceWrapper.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/PlatformInterfaceWrapper.kt), [BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt))
- **§121 — `setLocale` стал строгим в 1.14** ([BoxApplication.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxApplication.kt)). `golang.org/x/text/language` бросает на нестандартной локали (`ru_IL` = русский язык + регион Израиль) → краш в `onCreate` до старта ядра. Обёрнуто `runCatching{...}.recoverCatching{ setLocale(language) }` — деградация до голого языка, затем дефолт ядра.
- **§121 — `dnsServerAddress` стал `StringIterator`** ([BoxVpnService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxVpnService.kt)). Было одиночное `OptionalString` (`.value`) → теперь итерируется, `addDnsServer` на каждый непустой DNS-сервер, объявленный ядром.
- **§121 — `Libbox.setMemoryLimit`/`redirectStderr` удалены в 1.14** ([BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt), [BoxApplication.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxApplication.kt)). Императивные вызовы убраны; OOM-killer и stderr/crash-канал в 1.14 конфигурируются декларативно через `SetupOptions` (фактическая настройка полей — §173).
- **§122 — главный экран переписан на CommandClient-стримы** ([home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart), [heartbeat.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller/heartbeat.dart), [ping_orchestration.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller/ping_orchestration.dart)). `home_controller` подписан на `_cc.status`/`_cc.groups`; `switchNode`→`selectOutbound`; heartbeat-watchdog по тишине status-стрима (5с/8с), не по HTTP-fetch; ping_orchestration `runNode/Mass/GroupUrltest`→`urlTestOutbound` (worker-pool 10).
- **§122 — модель `HomeState` типизирована** ([home_state.dart](app/lib/models/home_state.dart)). `proxiesJson` (Clash-format `Map`) → `ccGroups (List<CcGroup>)` + типизированные методы `groupOf`/`urltestNowOf`/`isControlTag`/`selectorGroupTags`/`urltestGroups`. `TrafficSnapshot`/`AppStat` вынесены в [traffic_snapshot.dart](app/lib/models/traffic_snapshot.dart); парсер `route.final` в [route_config.dart](app/lib/config/route_config.dart); `packageNameFromProcess` в [process_name.dart](app/lib/services/process_name.dart).
- **§122 — `experimental.clash_api` убран из конфига** ([wizard_template.json](app/assets/wizard_template.json), [build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart), [ConfigManager.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/ConfigManager.kt)). На ядре 1.14 без `with_clash_api` блок `clash_api` в конфиге → fatal `clash api is not included` (не no-op). Блок вырезан из шаблона (`cache_file` сохранён), удалён `_ensureClashApiDefaults`, добавлен `ConfigManager.stripClashApi` (защита старых сохранённых конфигов).
- **§166 — ошибки показываются нижним SnackBar** ([home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart), [app_banner.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/app_banner.dart)). `lastError` (ошибки пинга, старт VPN, auto→not connected) был верхним красным баннером (15с, перекрывал контент) → floating SnackBar снизу (5с). `config_load_error` (actionable рестарт) остаётся отдельным баннером.
- **§104 — ядро sing-box-lx → `v1.14.0-lx.1`** ([libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version)). База upstream `v1.14.0-alpha.33` (DNS-rework, native API service, closed-история соединений). Сборки: основной AAR (SDK23+) + legacy (SDK21). Version-gate сравнивается по префиксу `1.14.0-lx.1`, не точным равенством.
- **§051/§030 — `wifi_ssid`/`wifi_bssid` переехали в headless rule_set** ([custom_rules.dart](app/lib/services/builder/post_steps/custom_rules.dart), [§051 task](docs/spec/tasks/051-custom-rule-wifi-conditions.md)). §051 эмитил wifi-условия на routing-rule level, т.к. под 1.12 headless rule_set их не принимал. В 1.14 `DefaultHeadlessRule` принимает `wifi_ssid`/`wifi_bssid` (сверено `option/rule_set.go:207-208`) → для inline-правил они теперь в headless `match` (AND с domain/port внутри rule_set). Для srs — остаются route-level (своего headless нет). DNS-mirror (§117) для inline больше не дублирует `wifi_*` в dns-rule body — оно уже в shared rule_set. Поведение матчинга эквивалентно (та же AND-семантика), меняется только JSON-форма; §051-тесты обновлены под 1.14. Device-verified (CPH2411): ядро 1.14 принимает headless rule_set с `wifi_ssid`/`source_ip_cidr` без fatal, туннель поднимается.

### Fixed

- **§143 — «Interrupt connections on switch» восстановлен (§122-gap закрыт после §174)** ([home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/143-interrupt-connections-on-node-switch.md)). При §122-миграции функция сломалась: `_connectionIdsInGroup` была заглушкой `const []` (считалось, что `CcConnection` потерял `chains`). §174 восстановил `chains` → матчим соединения на selector-группу через `chains.contains(group)`, закрываем только живые (`!isClosed`). Метод стал async — снапшот соединений из `_cc.connections.first` (replay-кэш стрима; `HomeState` список не хранит, только агрегаты). Гейт `getInterruptOnSwitch`/loop `closeConnection`/5-сек дедлайн не тронуты — заработали с реальными id.
- **detour-схема на экране подписки рисовалась задом наперёд** ([subscription_settings_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/subscription_detail_screen/widgets/subscription_settings_tab.dart)). Цепочка показывалась как `Nodes → detour → Internet` (detour выглядел выходным), противореча экрану сервера (`Phone → detour → нода → Internet`) и физике (detour = «route through another server **first**», входной хоп). Исправлено на `Phone → detour → Nodes → Internet`.
- **§173 — OOM-killer не настроен после миграции на `SetupOptions`** ([BoxApplication.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxApplication.kt), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/173-oom-killer-setup-options.md)). До 1.14 `Libbox.setMemoryLimit(true)` включал Go soft-limit; в 1.14 API удалён, конфиг ушёл в `SetupOptions`, но поля не были перенесены → рантайм работал без memory-лимита (`debug.SetMemoryLimit(MaxInt64)`) → на слабых устройствах ядро могло попасть под Android lowmemorykiller; плюс потерян stderr/crash-канал. Фикс: в `SetupOptions` дописаны `oomKillerEnabled=true` + `oomMemoryLimit=200 MB` (Go soft-limit ~150 MB; на Android дефолта нет — лимит обязателен явно) + `crashReportSource="lxbox"` (stderr → `CrashReport-lxbox.log`, восстановлен §038). Заодно `/help` вычищен от удалённых в §122 Clash-роутов (`/state/clash`, urltest «через `/proxies`/`/group`» → `urlTestOutbound`), «Clash-порт 63130» → «CommandServer-порт 63130».
- **§172 — битый detour ронял весь конфиг** ([heal_dangling_detours.dart](app/lib/services/builder/post_steps/heal_dangling_detours.dart), [build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/172-heal-dangling-detour.md)). Подписка задаёт ноде `detour` (нативная цепочка или `detourPolicy.overrideDetour`) на outbound, которого нет в собранном конфиге — напр. `detour: "warp gen"`, когда WARP-цель выключена. Один dangling detour → `DanglingDetourRef` (fatal) → sing-box реджектил **весь** config → `Config invalid (N issues)`, VPN не вставал. Фикс (как §169 с REALITY): post-step `healDanglingDetours` перед валидацией снимает `detour` на несуществующий tag — нода работает напрямую, конфиг валиден; снятые detour'ы → в `emitWarnings` («Detour убран…»). Device: rebuild → 0 битых detour (было fatal). Источник подписки в тексте ошибки — отдельной задачей.
- **§169 (критический) — битый REALITY pbk ронял весь конфиг** ([uri_utils.dart](app/lib/services/parser/uri_utils.dart), [transport.dart](app/lib/services/parser/transport.dart), [json_parsers.dart](app/lib/services/parser/json_parsers.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/169-reality-pbk-validation.md)). Кривые публичные подписки вешают на обычную `security=tls` ноду мусор `pbk=enabled/true`; парсер строил REALITY по «pbk непустой» → мусор уходил в `reality.public_key` → sing-box видел не-X25519 → отвергал **весь** `config.json` → VPN не поднимался. Фикс: REALITY включается только при валидном X25519 (ровно 32 байта через `isValidRealityPublicKey`); невалидный pbk → деградация в plain TLS (нода остаётся рабочей). +нормализация `short_id` в JSON-ветках (Xray + sing-box), как в URI-пути. Регрессия зелёная (56 reality-нод, ядро без `invalid public_key`). Референс ядра 1:1: `node_parser_transport.go:220-298`.
- **§168 — профайлер Live/per-app не наполнялся** ([traffic_profiler.dart](app/lib/services/traffic_profiler.dart), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/168-profiler-on-commandclient-connections.md)). После выпила Clash API (§122) профайлер остался на пустом fetcher → `buffer_count=0`, ни одного tcp/udp open/close в буфере. Источник событий переведён на `CcChannel.connections` push-стрим через `connectProfiler()` (фоновый `profilerClient`, §164 его не паузит → recording живёт свёрнутым); per-app атрибуция через `CcConnection.packageName` напрямую. Удалены `_pollConnections`/`_connectionsFetcher`/`bindRuntime`. Device: `buffer_count` восстановлен (9, было 0), атрибуция verified (gsf/chrome).
- **§170 (критический) — заход в Stats при Live recording ронял процесс** ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [live_events_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/live_events_tab.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/170-connections-accumulator-per-client-race.md)). `screenClient` (Stats) и `profilerClient` (Live, §168) — оба на `CommandConnections` — писали в **один** общий `connectionsAccumulator` из двух gRPC-горутин ядра → `libbox.Connections.ApplyEvents` рвал `connectionMap` без мьютекса → `fatal error: concurrent map iteration and map write` → SIGABRT всего процесса (~20с после старта recording). Фикс (клиент-сторона, лечение причины): `screenAccumulator` + `profilerAccumulator` — отдельный `Connections` на клиента → две независимые Go-map, горутины не пересекаются. +UI-троттл `live_events_tab` (пересборка ≤3000-списка от КОНЦА окна, не на каждое SSE). Device vc2818: Stats+Live >70с под трафиком + стресс 4× stop/start = 0 краш-строк. Долг ядра (мьютекс в `command_types.go`) — отдельно.
- **§174 — цепочка outbound (`chains`) терялась в Live/профайлере** ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [cc_channel.dart](app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart), [traffic_profiler.dart](app/lib/services/traffic_profiler.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/174-restore-connection-chains.md)). При §122-миграции цепочку `selector→urltest→node` заменили одиночным `outbound`, посчитав что ядро не сериализует chains. Ядро их отдаёт, но достаются они **методом-итератором** `Connection.chain()`, а не полем — мы его не читали. Фикс: Kotlin best-effort читает `c.chain()` в `chains` (null-safe `runCatching`), Dart получает `CcConnection.chains: List<String>`, профайлер пишет реальную цепочку (`fallback [outbound]` для прямых). `rulePayload` оставлен `''` — паритет с Clash (там всегда захардкожен `""`). Профайлер-тест 33 зелёных.
- **§171 — DNS не показывался в Live** ([BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/171-ansi-strip-bare-esc-dns.md)). Sing-box обрамляет conn_id **голыми** ESC-байтами (`[<ESC>759645927<ESC> 20ms]`), а ANSI-strip `ansiEscapeRe` ловил только классические CSI-цвета (`[…<letter>`) без ESC → escape-байты доезжали до Dart → DNS-regex профайлера `\[(\d+)…dns:` не матчил (после `[` стоял ESC, не цифра) → Live без DNS (TCP/UDP не задеты — они из connections-стрима, не из логов). Фикс: `Regex("\[[0-9;]*[A-Za-z]|")` срезает CSI И голые ESC. Device vc2819: 10 `dnsResolve` в Live (было 0).
- **§122 — заход в Stats рвал VPN** ([cc_channel.dart](app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart)). Каждый EventChannel держит ровно один нативный sink; независимые подписчики затирали sink друг друга → StatsScreen обнулял status-sink главного экрана → watchdog видел тишину → ложный мёртвый туннель → revoke+stop. Фикс: один внутренний upstream-`listen` на стрим + фан-аут через `StreamController.broadcast`; нативный sink ставится на первом Dart-подписчике, снимается на последнем.
- **§122 — главный экран пустой при старте** ([home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart), [cc_channel.dart](app/lib/vpn/cc_channel.dart)). Одноразовый снапшот групп терялся (регрессия broadcast-фикса). Фикс: постоянный upstream-`listen` + кэш `last` + `Stream.multi`-replay — поздний подписчик получает последнее значение; `status`/`groups.listen` (ставят нативный sink) до `connectScreen()`, чтобы убрать гонку snapshot-before-sink; `resetCaches()` на disconnect — reconnect не реплеит протухшие группы.
- **§122 — статистика пустая (Stats показывает 0)** ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [connections_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/connections_screen.dart)). `applyConnectionEvents` рано выходил при `ccConnectionsSink==null` → терял дельты соединений пока Stats закрыт (ConnectionEvents — дельты, потеря ломает аккумулятор навсегда). Фикс: всегда `applyEvents` (+`filterState Active`), эмит в Dart-sink только при наличии подписчика.
- **§122 — Conns показывали 0/0 (дельта вместо total)** ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [connections_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/connections_screen.dart)). `getUplink`/`getDownlink` — per-tick дельта (0 на простаивающих conn), `getUplinkTotal`/`getDownlinkTotal` — накопленное. Фикс: `uplink`/`downlink` ← `*Total`, дельты сохранены как `uplinkDelta`/`downlinkDelta`. Заодно проброшены `getOutbound`/`getOutboundType`/`getProtocol` в тайл.
- **§122 — `setStatusInterval` в наносекундах, не миллисекундах** ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt)). `daemon/started_service.go` использует `time.Duration(request.Interval)` → прежний `1000L` = 1µs → стрим эмитил максимально часто → мельтешение памяти каждый тик, лишний CPU/батарея. Фикс: `STATUS_INTERVAL_NS = 1_000_000_000` (1с). Заодно восстановлены app-иконки через `getProcessInfo()`.
- **§122 — пустые группы (два корня)** ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt), [home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart)). (A) дребезг `setStatus(Stopped)` без дедупа: поздний `Stopped` после reconnect-`Started` сбрасывал live-state → нативный дедуп (тот же статус + нет ошибки = no-op) + Dart stale-guard. (B, основной) ядро иногда пушит пустой `groups:[]` поверх заполненного дерева → guard в `_onCcGroups` игнорит пустой push, если `ccGroups` уже непуст.
- **§122 — `screenClient` не ref-counted** ([BoxCommandClient.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxCommandClient.kt), [stats_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen.dart)). `disconnectScreen()` из dispose StatsScreen убивал клиент, нужный главному экрану → после захода в Stats главный переставал обновлять группы. Фикс: `connectScreen` инкремент / `disconnectScreen` декремент, `shutdownAll` → ref=0. +host-fallback для пустого `CcConnection.domain`.
- **§166 — фриз Stats/Conns при FAST 0.1с** ([stats_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen.dart), [connections_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/connections_screen.dart)). Тяжёлый пересчёт на каждый снапшот (цикл по conns + `ruleName` + `setState` всего дерева) ×10/сек захлёбывал UI. Фикс: троттл пересчёта/`setState` 700мс (closed-tracking остался каждый тик — не пропустить закрытия), статические regex в `ruleName`.
- **§122 — имена правил вместо обрезков** ([stats_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen.dart), [connections_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/connections_screen.dart)). Билдер зашивает `custom_rules[].name` как тег `rule_set` → ядро отдаёт `rule_set=<имя>`. `ruleName()`: `rule_set=Home wifi` → `Home wifi`, набор srs → первый тег, хвост `=> route(...)` отрезается; `final`/`direct` as-is.
- **§122 — пустой `rule` → `final`** ([connections_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/connections_screen.dart), [stats_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen.dart)). Соединения по `route.final` (default-маршрут без явного matched-правила) ядро отдаёт с пустым `getRule()` → показывали `—`. Возвращаем `final`, как Clash; согласовано в 4 местах (устранена несогласованность `direct` vs `final` в byRule-агрегации).

### Removed

- **§044 — мусор от старой текстовой DNS-жизни профайлера** ([traffic_profiler.dart](app/lib/services/traffic_profiler.dart)). После перехода на структурный DNS-стрим (§180) выпилен мёртвый код парсинга core-лога: лог-листенер (`_ensureLogListenerAttached`/`_drainNewLogEntries`/`_processLogLine`/`_packageRe`/`_appLogListener`) и write-only мапа `_connIdToMeta`/`_ConnMeta` (TCP-атрибуция из router-лога — не читалась, owner идёт из ядра `CcConnection.packageName` с §168). Профайлер больше не парсит core-лог вообще. Также убрана inferred-эвристика Strategy 4 (`_inferProcessByIp` по recent DNS-IP) — безымянный TCP теперь `unattributed` вместо `inferred` (`ConfidenceLevel.inferred`/`processInferred` оставлены dormant для совместимости exported session JSON).

## [2.4.4] — 2026-06-23

Hotfix: пресет «Unknown traffic» (`block_unknown`) со значением по умолчанию ронял конфиг — `Config invalid: Rule "rules[N]" references missing outbound "reject"` на вкладке Servers, VPN не стартовал, плашка «settings changed» горела не гасясь. Подтверждено на устройстве.

### Fixed

- **§162 — пресет «Unknown traffic» (`block_unknown`) на дефолте → fatal `Rule "rules[N]" references missing outbound "reject"`** ([preset_expand.dart](app/lib/services/builder/preset_expand.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/162-block-unknown-default-reject-outbound.md)). `reject` в sing-box — это `action`, не outbound-tag; правило `{outbound:"reject"}` ядро/валидатор реджектит. Пресет задаёт `rule.outbound:"@outbound"` + `default_value:"reject"`, но нормализация `reject→action` срабатывала только в override-ветке (когда юзер ЯВНО выбрал Reject в пикере, т.е. ключ есть в `varsValues`). При включённом-но-нетронутом пресете `varsValues` пуст, `@outbound` подставлялся в `"reject"` дефолтом, override-ветка пропускалась → литерал `outbound:"reject"` уезжал в `route.rules`. Отсюда «у одних работает, у других fatal»; битый конфиг не сохранялся (§141 блокирует save) → плашка «settings changed» горела не гасясь. Фикс — безусловный backstop в `expandPreset`: `if (result['outbound']=='reject') → action:reject`, нормализует финальный результат независимо от override/дефолта. Инвариант билдера (контракт sing-box `reject==action`), а не забота шаблона. Переживает обновление без migration: пресет персистит только `{presetId, varsValues}`, правило ребилдится из шаблона. Подтверждено на устройстве (app-логи + собранный конфиг). +1 регресс-тест.
- **Плашка «Settings changed — tap to rebuild config» не реагировала на тап по большей части ширины** ([app_banner.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/app_banner.dart)). `GestureDetector` оборачивал плашку с дефолтным `HitTestBehavior.deferToChild` → тап засчитывался лишь при попадании точно в непрозрачный child (иконку/текст); короткий текст в широком контейнере оставлял справа большую «мёртвую» зону. Фикс — `behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque`: тап ловится по всей площади плашки. Чинит и прочие кликабельные плашки (`restart`, `config_load_error`).
- **§161 (часть 2) — пустое required-поле → подстановка `default_value`** ([template_var_list.dart](app/lib/widgets/template_var_list.dart), [build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/161-urltest-tolerance-uint16.md)). Стёртое required-поле (`tolerance` и т.п.) уходило в конфиг как `""` → ядро падало на decode так же, как и от вне-диапазонного значения. Правило `value.isEmpty && v.required && v.defaultValue.isNotEmpty && type!='secret' → default` применяется на трёх точках: (1) «UI сам чинит» — `TemplateVarListView.initState` подставляет default при загрузке и персистит, исправляя накопившиеся битые значения у юзеров при открытии экрана; (2) build_config backstop при merge vars (ДО substitution, не трогает `#if`) — ловит импорт бэкапа/пресета и legacy-state; (3) блок persist пустого required в UI + `errorText: "Required"`. optional-vars (§033 `required:false`) и `secret` исключены — для них пусто легитимно. Подмена НЕ делается внутри `#if`/substitution (сломала бы `#isEmpty`-предикаты). +8 тестов.

## [2.4.3] — 2026-06-23

Hotfix: с включённым Auto Proxy ядро не стартовало — `decode config: outbounds[N].tolerance: cannot unmarshal string into ... uint16`. Затрагивало всех, у кого в канале активен Auto Proxy.

### Fixed

- **§161 — `urltest_tolerance` уходило строкой в uint16-поле ядра** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/161-urltest-tolerance-uint16.md), [wizard_template.json](app/assets/wizard_template.json)). Нода была объявлена `type:text` → `coerceVarValue` оставлял `"30"` строкой → в `config.outbounds[].tolerance` уходила строка → ядро (база sing-box 1.13.13, где `URLTest.tolerance` — строгий `uint16`) падало на decode до старта туннеля. Срабатывало у каждого с активным Auto Proxy (urltest-группа `@auto_proxy_tag`); регрессия с 39ca0bd, где литерал `"tolerance": 100` заменили на переменную. Фикс: `type:text`→`type:int` → `coerceVarValue("30","int")` → число `30`. UI поля не меняется (тот же combobox-edit с пресетами `10/30/50/100/200`).
- **§161 — clamp `int`-var в uint16 `[0, 65535]`** ([if_engine.dart](app/lib/services/builder/if_engine.dart), [template_var_list.dart](app/lib/widgets/template_var_list.dart)). Вне-диапазонное число в любом числовом поле (`tolerance`/`proxy_port`) роняло ядро на decode. Закрыто на двух слоях: coerce-backstop (`n.clamp(0,65535)` — ловит ручной ввод, импорт бэкапа, legacy) + UI (`keyboardType:number` + `digitsOnly`-formatter + clamp в onChanged). Текущий диапазон единый для всех `int`; per-node `min`/`max` через поля шаблона — будущей таской.

## [2.4.2] — 2026-06-23

Движок шаблона переписан на типизированную подстановку с декларативными `#if` (§120): VPN-mode больше не собирается императивным кодом, а описан прямо в `wizard_template.json`. Вкладка VPN Mode стала data-driven — контролы рендерятся из template-нод, а listen-адрес прокси теперь произвольный IPv4 (комбобокс с подсказками `127.0.0.1`/`0.0.0.0`). Новый пресет «Block unknown traffic» режет неатрибутированный трафик в туннеле. Ядро → `v1.13.13-lx.15`.

### Added

- **§033 — preset «Block unknown traffic» (`block_unknown`)** ([wizard_template.json](app/assets/wizard_template.json)). Reject/direct трафика в туннеле без атрибуции к установленному приложению (фоновые/чужие процессы). Inline `rule_set {invert:true, package_name_regex:"^"}` матчит соединения с пустым `AndroidPackageNames` (на ядре `lx.15` подтверждено: `invert` флипает «есть пакет»→no-match, «нет пакета»→match). Outbound-var `reject|direct` (default `reject` → `action:reject`). UI-label — «Unknown traffic». ⚠ Caveat: ловит **всю** неатрибутированную атрибуцию (system/root UID, egress туннеля, сбой `find_process`), не только foreign-процессы.

### Changed

- **§120 — typed template engine + `#if`** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/120F-template-engine-typed-vars-and-if/spec.md)). Подстановка `@var` теперь коэрсит значение **строго по объявленному `WizardVar.type`**, а не угадыванием по содержимому: `bool`/`int` — типизируются, `secret`/`text`/`enum`/`outbound`/`dns_servers` — остаются строкой (пароль `1234` больше не становится int). Введён явный тип `int`; `tun_mtu` переведён `text`→`int`. Общее ядро подстановки и условных конструкций — новый `app/lib/services/builder/if_engine.dart` (`coerceVarValue`/`walk`/predicates/`Dropped`/RegExp-кэш), используется обоими движками (`build_config._substituteVars` + `preset_expand.substituteVars`).
- **§120 — `#if`-конструкт в шаблоне** (map-spread + array-element; предикаты `and`/`or`/`#in`/`#notIn`/`#notEmpty`/`#isEmpty`/`#matches`/`#not`). Декларативная условность прямо в `config`/preset-телах; поглощает прежний `enabled:"@var"`-гейт (§045). Дизайн заимствован у десктопного лаунчера (SPEC 067), без `params[]` и `@runtime.*`.
- **§120/§119 — VPN-mode стал декларативным; `applyVpnMode` удалён.** `tun-in`/`mixed-in` в `inbounds[]` и `inbound` в route-rules собираются `#if`-walker'ом по `@vpn_mode` (`vpn`/`proxy`/`vpn_proxy`); `users` внутри `mixed-in` — map-spread `#if` по `@proxy_auth`. Локальный socks/http прокси (mixed-in) теперь живёт в `wizard_template.json`, а не строится императивно в коде. `inbound` в route-rules — `Listable[string]`-массив (тождественно скаляру для sing-box). Защита от broken-auth сохранена: пустой пароль при включённом auth (в т.ч. форс на `0.0.0.0`) → `users` отсутствует, не `[{"":""}]`.
- **§120 — template-load валидация `#if`** ([if_engine.dart](app/lib/services/builder/if_engine.dart) `validateIfConstructs`). Кривой `#if` в шаблоне (оба `and`+`or`, нет `value`, предикат на необъявленную var, type-mismatch, неизвестный оператор, битый regexp) → `TemplateIfError` на загрузке, а не молча битый конфиг.
- **§119 — VPN Mode tab data-driven из template-нод** ([vpn_mode_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/vpn_mode_tab.dart)). Контролы вкладки рендерятся по `WizardVar`-нодам секции «VPN Mode» (`title`/`tooltip`/`options` читаются из шаблона), значения мапятся в типизированный `VpnModeConfig`, а не в `userVars`. Метаданные UI вынесены в `wizard_template.json` (`proxy_*` получили `title`/`tooltip`/`options`); vars остаются hidden, реальный UI — в VPN Settings → Mode.
- **§119 — proxy listen: произвольный IPv4 вместо двух фиксированных значений** ([vpn_mode_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/vpn_mode_tab.dart), [vpn_mode.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage/vpn_mode.dart)). `SegmentedButton` (`127.0.0.1`/`0.0.0.0`) → редактируемый комбобокс с IPv4-валидацией: можно выбрать подсказку или вписать любой адрес (`127.10.20.5`, LAN-IP). Свободный ввод коммитится на focus-loss. `isPublicListen` теперь `= !loopback`, а не строго `== 0.0.0.0`: auth форсится на **любой** не-loopback адрес (конкретный LAN-IP так же виден извне, как `0.0.0.0` → пароль обязателен). Добавлены `isValidListenAddr`/`isLoopback`.
- **§104 — ядро sing-box-lx → `v1.13.13-lx.15`** ([libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version)). `lx.14` → `lx.15` (нужен §033: `invert` + `package_name_regex` для match по пустому `AndroidPackageNames`).

## [2.4.1] — 2026-06-22

Per-app trace переделан (§160): 4 саб-таба → тогл Live/Aggregated с общим фильтром и drill-down деталями; общий движок `TraceExplorer` теперь питает и Stats→Live. Закрыт баг атрибуции — чужие приложения больше не протекают в сессию профайлера. Ядро без изменений — `v1.13.13-lx.14`.

### Changed

- **§160 — per-app trace redesign** ([task](docs/spec/tasks/160-perapp-trace-live-aggregated-redesign.md), [feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/044F-per-app-traffic-profiler/spec.md)). 4 саб-таба Live/Domains/IPs/Connections → тогл **Live / Aggregated** (`SegmentedButton`) + ось by Domain/by IP. Connections удалён (дубль Live), Domains+IPs слиты в `AggregatedView`. Общий фильтр сверху (поиск + чипы типа события) на оба режима + пауза Live. **Drill-down по тапу** в обоих режимах: `traffic_event_detail_sheet` (событие) и `aggregate_detail_sheet` (свод + список соединений → событие); host/IP/process внутри sheet кликабельны → в общий поиск.
- **§160 — единый движок `TraceExplorer`** ([trace_explorer.dart](app/lib/screens/stats_screen/trace_explorer.dart)) — тогл/фильтр/детали/пауза вынесены в общий виджет; per-app trace и Stats→Live — тонкие обёртки над ним (без дубля логики). `computeTraceAggregates` вынесен из `Session._recompute`; sheet'ы и `AggregatedView` развязаны от `Session`. Live получил Aggregated+детали+паузу «бесплатно».
- **§160 — счётчик соединений в агрегате = активные/всего** (`0/5 conns`), активные = `max(0, open − close)` по ключу. (`15da916`)

### Fixed

- **§160 — чужие приложения протекали в сессию профайлера** ([traffic_profiler.dart](app/lib/services/traffic_profiler.dart)). Атрибуция считалась на `open` (чужие отбрасывались), но `tcpClose` писался в сессию безусловно → `verified`-события посторонних приложений (youtube/imo/gsf/heytap) в сессии цели (по Debug API — 14/54 чужих `tcpClose` в сессии Telegram). Фикс: атрибуция фиксируется на `open` (`_ConnSnapshot.inSession`) и наследуется `close`'ом — чужие close уходят, target + unattributed остаются. Регрессия `traffic_profiler_test.dart` «non-target connection close also ignored». (`15da916`)

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-22

Public Intent API (§047) — управление L×Box из Tasker/MacroDroid/Llama/Automate. Детальный разбор соединений (Stats→Conns: bottom sheet, подсветка зависших, иконки приложений), вычистка интерфейса до English-only, строгий allowlist на импорте настроек, hardening границы JNI. Ядро → `v1.13.13-lx.14`.

### Added

- **§047 — Public Intent API (automation)** ([docs/AUTOMATION.md](docs/AUTOMATION.md), [feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/047F-public-intent-api/spec.md)). Управление L×Box из автоматизаторов двумя способами: **Plugin** (L×Box виден в Tasker/Locale как Action + State, команда выбирается мышкой через нативный экран) и **raw broadcast** (`am broadcast` с action-строкой для shell/ADB/не-plugin). 9 actions (`START_VPN`/`STOP_VPN`/`TOGGLE_VPN`, `SWITCH_NODE`, `SET_GROUP`, `URLTEST_GROUP`, `REFRESH_SUBS`, `REBUILD_CONFIG`, `RESET_NETWORK`), исходящие события (`VPN_CONNECTED`/`DISCONNECTED`/`ERROR`/`REVOKED`, `ACTIVE_NODE`/`GROUP_CHANGED`, `SUB_REFRESHED`/`FAILED`, `UPDATE_AVAILABLE`, `PERMISSION_NEEDED`). Opt-in: по умолчанию выключено, включается в App Settings → Automation. (`77fd71a`, `8b4b410`, `544ef40`)
- **§152 — Conns: детальный bottom sheet по тапу** ([connection_detail_sheet.dart](app/lib/screens/connections_screen/connection_detail_sheet.dart), [task](docs/spec/tasks/152-conn-detail-sheet.md)). Тайл соединения tappable → полная инфа (host, chain, process, rule, byte-счётчики, длительность) без обрезки `ellipsis`.
- **§153 — Conns: подсветка зависших однобоких TCP** ([connections_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/connections_screen.dart), [task](docs/spec/tasks/153-oneway-conn-highlight.md)). Соединения с сигнатурой залипания (напр. `↑517 ↓0`) подсвечиваются розовым.
- **§154 — Conns: иконка приложения в строке** ([task](docs/spec/tasks/154-conn-app-icon-and-i18n.md)). Launcher-иконка приложения-владельца соединения рядом с `processPath`.

### Changed

- **Ядро → `v1.13.13-lx.14`** ([libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version)) — фикс GRO split-brain на WG-endpoint (медленный download на LTE без detour; `UDP_GRO` гейтился за `runtime.GOOS==linux` → склеенный recv ломал AEAD на download). (`8fef581`)
- **§156 — UI English-only** ([task](docs/spec/tasks/156-ui-english-only-cyrillic-cleanup.md)) — вычистка кириллицы из интерфейса и Debug API.
- **§158 — App Settings: вкладки центрированы** (`TabAlignment.center`) + двусторонний edge-fade `ShaderMask` ([task](docs/spec/tasks/158-settings-tabs-center-alignment.md)).
- **§157 — убрана нерабочая галка «Require permission»** из automation (Dart+native+manifest+docs) ([task](docs/spec/tasks/157-automation-drop-require-permission.md)).
- **§155 — аудит проекта (июнь 2026) + быстрые победы** ([task](docs/spec/tasks/155-audit-2026-06-quick-wins.md)) — native crash-safety, catch-логи, актуализация docs-статусов, disambiguation.

### Fixed

- **§151 — JNI-iterator no-throw + ALPN double-decode + LocalResolver SERVFAIL** ([task](docs/spec/tasks/151-jni-iterator-throw-and-alpn-double-decode.md)). Разобран механизм abort через JNI: throw из Kotlin-callback роняет процесс (`Runtime::Abort`) только если Go-метод возвращает `void`/value без `error`. **F1** — итераторы `StringIterator`/`NetworkInterfaceIterator` не бросают `NoSuchElementException` за концом, а возвращают пустой элемент (единственный подтверждённый abort-класс). **F2** — `alpn=http%252F1.1` не уходит мусором в ядро (повторный decode + валидация в парсере). **F3** — LocalResolver возвращает `ctx.errorCode(SERVFAIL)` вместо шумного `error()` при потере сети. (`80ea81b`)
- **§159 — строгий allowlist (default-deny) на импорте настроек** ([task](docs/spec/tasks/159-backup-allowlist-strict-filter.md)). Импорт фильтруется по белому списку ключей; экспорт расфильтрован симметрично; отброшенные ключи → applog + снэкбар; `ping_options` strip; распутан seed. (`63c601c`)
- **§154 — чистка package name из `processPath`** перед резолвом иконки (формат ядра `pkg (pkg)` / `pkg (user)` → чистый pkg). (`ab875ce`)

## [2.3.5] — 2026-06-18

Лейблы уровня AWG (`awg` / `awg1.5` / `awg2`) с masquerade-суффиксом `+`, импорт серверов из файла, стабилизационные фиксы из глубокого аудита кода (§141). Ядро → `v1.13.13-lx.12`.

### Added

- **§148 — лейблы уровня AWG** ([validation.dart](app/lib/models/validation.dart), [task](docs/spec/tasks/148-awg-version-labels.md)). Нода показывает `awg` / `awg1.5` / `awg2` по официальной классификации AmneziaWG (структурно по сырому JSON, по старшему присутствующему маркеру). Masquerade (`ip`/`id`/`ib`) добавляет суффикс `+`.
- **§149 — Servers «Import from file…»** ([servers_screen](app/lib/screens), [task](docs/spec/tasks/149-servers-import-from-file.md)). Новый пункт overflow-меню (⋮) для импорта конфига/подписки из локального файла.
- **§147 — Debug API `POST /warp`** ([warp.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/warp.dart), [task](docs/spec/tasks/147-debug-api-warp-endpoint.md)). Программная регистрация WARP-узла без UI (тот же путь, что кнопка Get WARP). Все поля опциональны; `obfuscate=true` → §143 masquerade; `?rebuild=true` регенерирует конфиг. Debug-only (bind 127.0.0.1, bearer-token).

### Changed

- **Ядро → `v1.13.13-lx.12`** ([libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version)) — обратно-совместимо с lx.11; добавляет основу для §146 fragmented-QUIC. Версия ядра нигде в коде не зашита — только в пине.
- **§148 — `awg+` невозможен**: masquerade поднимает базу минимум до `awg1.5+`.
- **§141 — централизация имён платформенных каналов** ([platform_channels.dart](app/lib/services/platform_channels.dart)). Строки `MethodChannel`/`EventChannel` дублировались в 6+ файлах → опечатка молча рвала канал. Сведены в один источник истины.
- **§141 — magic-numbers debug-порта** → константы `SettingsStorage.debugPortMin`/`debugPortMax`.

### Fixed

- **§141 — JNI no-throw** ([BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt), [task](docs/spec/tasks/141-deep-code-audit-hardening.md)). `serviceReload`/`getSystemProxyStatus`/`setSystemProxyEnabled` — внешнее тело в `runCatching` + fail-safe. Unchecked exception через JNI = `Runtime::Abort` всего процесса (крашило старые API).
- **§141 — `cancelMassPing()` в disconnected/revoked-ветке** `_handleStatusEvent` ([home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart)) — симметрия с `_onTunnelDead`.
- **§141 — анти-зомби стрима**: `.handleError` на status-broadcast перед `asBroadcastStream` ([box_vpn_client.dart](app/lib/vpn/box_vpn_client.dart)).
- **§141 — гонки read-after-await**: снимок `tunnelUp` снимается один раз после `await`.
- **§148 — чистка WARP endpoint-пула** ([warp_endpoints.json](app/assets/warp_endpoints.json)): убраны дохлые/режущиеся на LTE-DPI 8.x-блоки; остались твёрдые anycast `162.159.192/195` + `188.114.96-98`.

## [2.3.4] — 2026-06-16

Новый механизм WARP-обфускации: маскировка под протокол (`QUIC`/`DNS`/`STUN`/`SIP`) теперь генерируется ядром по декларативным полям `id/ip/ib` (WireSock-style). Требует ядра `v1.13.13-lx.11`.

### Changed

- **§143 — WARP-обфускация на core masquerade `id/ip/ib`** ([warp_client.dart](app/lib/services/warp/warp_client.dart), [node_spec.dart](app/lib/models/node_spec.dart), [warp_wizard_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/warp_wizard_screen.dart), [task](docs/spec/tasks/143-warp-masquerade-id-ip-ib.md)). Раньше LxBox генерировал junk-пакет `i1` сам в Dart (QUIC Initial). Теперь маскировка задаётся тремя полями — `ip` (протокол: QUIC/DNS/STUN/SIP), `id` (домен), `ib` (браузер: Chrome/Firefox/cURL при QUIC) — и сам пакет генерирует ядро `v1.13.13-lx.11`. В визарде (Advanced) — выбор протокола, домена и браузера. Для `DNS`/`SIP` домен виден на проводе (QNAME / SIP-host); для `QUIC`/`STUN` — нет (декоративен). Проверено на устройстве: туннель поднимается, трафик идёт.
- **Ядро → `v1.13.13-lx.11`** ([libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version)) — поддержка `id/ip/ib` masquerade (downstream 009).

### Removed

- **§143 — выпилен Dart-генератор `i1`.** Удалены `quic_i1.dart`, `aes_min.dart` (самописный AES), `pseudo_gen.dart` (генератор имён для SIP-junk), `JunkTemplate`, выбор шаблона QUIC/SIP и параметр QUIC level — всё это заменено генерацией на стороне ядра.

## [2.3.3] — 2026-06-16

Багфикс-релиз: WARP-обфускация (подключение через DPI), стабильность Stop/Start, упрощение настроек WARP.

### Fixed

- **§142 — WARP `reserved` (Cloudflare client_id) опционален.** Раньше `reserved` писался в каждый WARP-узел всегда — это привязка пакетов к нашей записи устройства в WARP-аккаунте (не к MAC/IP), которая на части сетей отбрасывается. Теперь `reserved` — опция (чекбокс «Bind to this device» в Advanced); дефолт по галке обфускации: обфускация вкл → reserved выкл (обезличенное подключение), plain WARP → reserved вкл. ([warp_account.dart](app/lib/services/warp/warp_account.dart), [subscription_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/subscription_controller.dart), [warp_wizard_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/warp_wizard_screen.dart), [task](docs/spec/tasks/142-warp-reserved-optional.md))
- **§136 — WARP junk-пакет i1: цельный валидный QUIC Initial.** Прежний i1 нарезался на CPS-сегменты `<b>/<r>`, и такой узел не поднимался. Теперь i1 = один сплошной `<b 0x…>` — валидный QUIC Initial 1250 байт (length-поле 1232, DCID=8), как у рабочих генераторов; GCM-тег и SNI проверены расшифровкой против RFC 9001 (A.1) и NIST GCM-векторов. Уникальность — рандомный DCID / TLS-random на каждую генерацию. ([quic_i1.dart](app/lib/services/warp/quic_i1.dart), [task](docs/spec/tasks/136-warp-quic-i1-generator.md))
- **§138 — WARP endpoint из Advanced не терялся при кешированном аккаунте.** При уже созданном WARP-аккаунте регистрация миновалась, и выбранный/рандомный endpoint из Advanced игнорировался — в узел шёл старый. Теперь endpoint резолвится до регистрации и применяется к узлу независимо от кеша. ([subscription_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/subscription_controller.dart), [task](docs/spec/tasks/138-warp-cached-account-ignores-endpoint.md))
- **§140 — стабильный Start после force-stop.** После обновления «поверх» VPN мог не стартовать: `Clash API: Connection refused` / `VPN taken by another app`. Две причины: (1) `doForceStop` звал `stopSelf()` до освобождения Clash-порта 63130 фоновым teardown → `bind: address already in use` на следующем старте; (2) transient-таймаут force-kill'ил здоровый `Connecting`. Теперь force-stop ждёт завершения teardown до `stopSelf()`, а таймаут на `Connecting` не убивает живой коннект. Проверено на устройстве. ([task](docs/spec/tasks/140-force-stop-port-race-and-connecting-timeout.md))

### Changed

- **§142 — упрощение настроек WARP-обфускации.** Убран выбор шаблона junk (QUIC/SIP) — всегда QUIC; убран параметр QUIC level. SNI-пул маскировки: добавлены `ozon.ru`, `telemost.yandex.ru`; исключены `youtube`, `amazon` (замедляются в RU-сетях → плохая мимикрия). SNI выбирается из списка / `Random` / вручную.

## [2.3.2] — 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **§136 — WARP-обфускация: junk-шаблон под настоящий QUIC** ([quic_i1.dart](app/lib/services/warp/quic_i1.dart), [warp_endpoint_picker.dart](app/lib/services/warp/warp_endpoint_picker.dart), [awg_junk.dart](app/lib/services/warp/awg_junk.dart), [warp_wizard_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/warp_wizard_screen.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/136-warp-quic-i1-generator.md)). По field-report из региона с жёстким DPI прежний junk-шаблон (WG-traffic / SIP) DPI провайдера **не пробивал**, а конфиги публичного `warp-generator` — работали из коробки. Реверс генератора показал: его i1 — это **настоящий QUIC Initial** (голый SNI-ClientHello, RFC 9001 крипта) с CPS-нарезкой `<b>/<r>`, где `<r>` рандомит изменчивые байты на каждый пакет (нет общей сигнатуры/beacon); endpoint — **чистый рандом** IP:port из зашитых Cloudflare-блоков, без скана. Слабый WG-traffic шаблон **заменён на QUIC** (SIP оставлен как второй вариант, выбор dropdown'ом); параметры QUIC (SNI / level 0-4 / Jc-Jmin-Jmax) — в Advanced с рабочими дефолтами; при включённой обфускации с дефолтным endpoint IP:port **рандомизируется** из блоков Cloudflare (`assets/warp_endpoints.json`). QUIC-маскировка подтверждена device-smoke. **DPI читает SNI внутри Initial** (крипта Initial публичная) → cloudflare-маркеры режутся: SNI-пул собран только из массовых легитимных доменов (глобальные + критичная инфраструктура РФ), `cloudflare-quic.com` исключён. Добавлен SNI combo-box (пул / `Random` / свой ввод); рандомный endpoint виден в поле сразу при включении обфускации.
- **§137 — Осмысленные имена WARP-узлов + накопление** ([warp_account.dart](app/lib/services/warp/warp_account.dart), [subscription_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/subscription_controller.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/137-warp-node-naming.md)). WARP-узлы теперь именуются по шаблону с эмодзи в теге: plain — `🔥☁️ WARP` / `🔥☁️ WARP+`, с AWG-обфускацией — `🔥⛈️ WARP (AWG 1.5)` (гроза вместо облака как визуальный сигнал «узел маскируется от DPI»). Убрана авто-замена прежних WARP-узлов при повторном Get WARP — теперь узлы **накапливаются** (юзер сам решает, нужны ли дубли с разными endpoint/SNI; лишние удаляет свайпом). Коллизия имени → суффикс ` 2`/` 3`.
- **UI — лейбл «Channel» inline с dropdown** ([home_controls.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/home_controls.dart)). Лейбл канала переехал на одну строку с выпадающим списком канала и ping-иконкой (`Channel [ VPN 1 ▾ ] [⚡]`) — раньше занимал отдельную строку сверху. Экономия вертикали на главном экране.

### Fixed

- **§139 — QS-плитка: белый квадрат в редакторе панели быстрых настроек** ([AndroidManifest.xml](app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/139-qs-tile-icon-manifest-rebrand.md)). На скрине шторки (HyperOS/MIUI, режим редактирования QS-панели) плитка L×Box показывала сплошной белый квадрат. Рецидив класса бага из task 015, но в другом месте: рантайм-иконка была правильной, а **статичная** манифест-иконка TileService указывала на `@mipmap/ic_launcher` — полноцветный лаунчер-логотип с непрозрачным фоном; Android прогоняет QS-иконку через монохромный tint, заливая всю непрозрачную область белым. Иконка перенацелена на тот же монохром-vector `@drawable/ic_lxbox_tile`, что используется в рантайме; манифест-превью ребрендировано под L×.
- **§135 — WARP: кастомный endpoint из Advanced больше не затирается** ([warp_client.dart](app/lib/services/warp/warp_client.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/135-warp-custom-endpoint-not-overwritten.md)). Юзер вписывал в Advanced свой `IP:port` (живой Cloudflare-endpoint на нестандартном порту), но в конфиг всё равно шёл дефолтный `engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408` — заблокированный его провайдером; Advanced-поле Endpoint было фактически мёртвым. Ответ Cloudflare (`_parseReg`) больше не перетирает пользовательский endpoint. +2 теста.
- **§134 — Node-list: последний узел не уезжает под нижние controls** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/134-node-list-bottom-spacer.md)). Добавлен bottom-spacer (одна строка запаса) под прокруткой списка узлов — последний узел больше не прячется за нижней панелью управления.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **§131 — Краш на старых GPU (Adreno 3xx, Android ≤10)** ([MainActivity.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/MainActivity.kt), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/131-impeller-adreno-gpu-crash.md)). На старых устройствах (например HTC One M8, LineageOS 10, GPU Adreno 330) приложение открывалось, но любое действие в интерфейсе мгновенно роняло его. Причина — несовместимость GPU-рендерера Flutter **Impeller** со старым драйвером Adreno 3xx (`libsc-a3xx.so`): его GLES-шейдеры валят драйвер с SIGSEGV в потоке `1.raster` (подтверждено tombstone'ом с устройства: `Impeller validation: Could not link pipeline program`). На `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 31` (Android ≤11) рендерер откатывается на Skia через shell-флаг `--enable-impeller=false` (override `getFlutterShellArgs`); на Android 12+ Impeller сохранён без изменений. Гейт по версии Android, а не по GPU (чистого рантайм-детекта GPU у Flutter нет) — для простого UI разница Skia↔Impeller незначима. Проверено на тест-устройстве Android 13 (Impeller сохранён, app alive); финальное подтверждение на реальном Adreno 3xx — у жалобщика. Tombstone опроверг гипотезу §128 (JNI callback crash) как причину этой жалобы; §128-фикс остаётся валидным сам по себе.

- **AmneziaWG detour на WireGuard больше не вешает приложение** ([тех.детали §129](docs/spec/tasks/129-vpnservice-force-stop-on-stuck-core.md), [§130](docs/spec/tasks/130-awg-detour-exclude-wireguard.md), issues [#2](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx/issues/2)/[#3](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx/issues/3)). Раньше AmneziaWG-узел с detour на WireGuard намертво вешал VPN на Android (туннель висел в «Connecting…», другие узлы не подключались, помогал только перезапуск приложения). Исправлено на трёх уровнях:
  - **Ядро** (sing-box-lx v1.13.13-lx.10): такой узел теперь отклоняется с понятной ошибкой вместо зависания — остальные узлы продолжают работать.
  - **UI**: при редактировании AmneziaWG-узла из списка Detour убраны все WireGuard-цели, а в строке Protocol показывается «AmneziaWG (wireguard)». Уже сохранённый невалидный detour сбрасывается при открытии настроек узла.
  - **Приложение**: если туннель всё же завис, VPN-сервис принудительно останавливается по таймауту, а не висит вхолостую — кнопка снова работает сразу.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **features/025 — Get WARP: регистрация Cloudflare WARP в один тап** ([warp_client.dart](app/lib/services/warp/warp_client.dart), [warp_account.dart](app/lib/services/warp/warp_account.dart), [warp_wizard_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/warp_wizard_screen.dart), [settings_storage/warp.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage/warp.dart), [feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/025F-warp-integration/spec.md)). Новый пункт **Get WARP** в overflow-меню Servers → полноэкранный визард → регистрирует устройство в Cloudflare и добавляет готовый WireGuard-узел. **Приватный ключ X25519 генерится на устройстве и НЕ покидает его** — в Cloudflare (`api.cloudflareclient.com`) уходит только публичный ключ; чужие воркеры-генераторы не используются. **WARP+** (опционально, под Advanced): license key → `PATCH account` (Argo Smart Routing); пусто = free WARP; битый ключ не ломает регистрацию (узел добавляется как free). **Идемпотентность**: повторный Get WARP переиспользует закешированный аккаунт (`warp_account` в storage), не плодя регистрации; *Re-register* форсит новый. Custom endpoint под Advanced (рабочий `IP:port`, если дефолтный заблокирован). WARP-узел помечается эмодзи 🔥☁️ и официальным логотипом-облаком Cloudflare на экране визарда.
- **§025 — WireGuard `reserved` (Cloudflare client_id)** ([node_spec.dart](app/lib/models/node_spec.dart), [node_spec_emit.dart](app/lib/models/node_spec_emit.dart), [wireguard_parser.dart](app/lib/services/parser/uri_parsers/wireguard_parser.dart), [uri_utils.dart](app/lib/services/parser/uri_utils.dart)). Добавлена поддержка per-peer `reserved: [b0,b1,b2]` (base64 client_id → 3 байта) — без него WARP-handshake проходит, но трафик не идёт. Парсинг (`reserved=`/`client_id=`, десятичный или base64), emit в endpoint-JSON и URI round-trip. Полезно для любого WARP-источника, не только Get WARP. +тесты.

### Fixed

- **§125 — Локальный versionCode согласован с релизным (`--split-per-abi`)** ([build-local-apk.sh](scripts/build-local-apk.sh), [install-apk.sh](scripts/install-apk.sh), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/125-local-versioncode-split-per-abi.md)). Локальная dev-сборка (vc ~610) не вставала поверх релизного arm64-APK (vc 2612) — downgrade, каждый dev-install требовал ручного бампа. Причина: CI собирает `--split-per-abi` (Flutter применяет ABI-множитель `1000×abiIndex + git-count` → arm64 = 2xxx), а локальный скрипт собирал single-ABI без множителя. Перевели `build-local-apk.sh` на `--split-per-abi --target-platform android-arm64` — versionCode попадает в тот же диапазон, что CI; `install-apk.sh` берёт `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`.
- **§025 — Детали узла: длинный server-хост ломал вёрстку** ([node_settings_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/node_settings_screen.dart)). `ListTile` с длинным значением в `trailing` (`engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408`) сжимал лейбл «Server» до нуля → он переносился вертикально по буквам. Значение перенесено в `subtitle` (полная ширина, перенос по словам). Баг общий для любого длинного `host:port`.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **features/119 — Режим работы VPN: Proxy / VPN / VPN+Proxy** ([vpn_mode_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/vpn_mode_tab.dart), [post_steps/vpn_mode.dart](app/lib/services/builder/post_steps/vpn_mode.dart), [settings_storage/vpn_mode.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage/vpn_mode.dart), [feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/119F-vpn-mode/spec.md)). Новый раздел настроек (3-я вкладка «Mode» в VPN Settings) с выбором того, как ядро ловит трафик: **VPN** — системный туннель через TUN (текущее поведение, default); **Proxy** — локальный прокси-порт без TUN (приложения настраиваются вручную, нет иконки ключа VPN); **VPN+Proxy** — туннель и локальный порт одновременно. Локальный прокси: выбор протокола **Mixed** (HTTP+SOCKS5 на одном порту), **HTTP** или **SOCKS5**; порт (default 2080); listen-адрес `127.0.0.1` (только это устройство) или `0.0.0.0` (LAN); авторизация логин/пароль с автогенерацией пароля (на `0.0.0.0` обязательна — снять нельзя). Реализовано чисто конфигом (sing-box `mixed`/`http`/`socks` inbound + трансформация `route.rules`), изменений в native Kotlin не потребовалось — libbox не вызывает `openTun` при отсутствии tun-inbound. Backward-compat: existing юзеры получают `mode=vpn` (байт-в-байт прежний конфиг).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **§123 — Имя сервера в шторке (foreground notification)** ([BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt), [ConfigManager.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/ConfigManager.kt), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/123-server-name-in-notification.md)). Раньше постоянное уведомление foreground-сервиса показывало только «L×Box / Connected» — из шторки нельзя было понять, на какой сервер идёт трафик. Теперь: **title** = `L×Box [final = <route.final>]` (сырое значение `route.final`), **text** = `<селектор>: <выбранная нода>` (например `vpn-1: L: 🇫🇮⚡Финляндия-2`). Архитектура: Dart владеет обеими строками (`ConfigManager.notificationText` + `setNotificationText`, симметрично `notificationTitle`), native их не затирает (fallback «Connected»); `HomeController._pushNotificationLabels()` собирает и шлёт лейблы из `_startInternal`/`applyGroup` (switchNode покрыт через `reloadProxies`). Проверено на устройстве (CPH2411).

### Fixed

- **§121 — Routing-тоггл пресета = король: выключение уносит DNS-хвосты** ([custom_rules.dart](app/lib/services/builder/post_steps/custom_rules.dart), [build_config.dart](app/lib/services/builder/build_config.dart), [dns_settings_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen.dart), [validator.dart](app/lib/services/builder/validator.dart), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/121-preset-routing-king-dns-orphans.md)). Field report: при выключении routing-тоггла пресета (`cr.enabled=false`) DNS-серверы пресета исчезали (orphan-cleanup работал), а DNS-правило оставалось хвостом, и выбранный resolver-tag (`dns.final` / `default_domain_resolver`) указывал в пустоту → sing-box реджектил конфиг «server not found» при старте. Решение — **routing-тоггл подчиняет DNS-аспект** (сознательно сужает §033): выключенный пресет не эмитит ни серверы, ни DNS-правила, ни mirror-lock (`dnsEnabled = cr.enabled && …`); orphan-cleanup правил стал симметричен серверам; автосброс `dns.final`→`local_dns_resolver` и `default_domain_resolver`→`cloudflare_udp` при исчезновении сервера; новый fatal-валидатор `DanglingDnsServerRef` ловит битую ссылку до отправки в ядро.
- **§119 — Allow-list + DNS на MIUI: форсим underlying-сеть (`NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_VPN`)** ([DefaultNetworkListener.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/DefaultNetworkListener.kt), [task spec](docs/spec/tasks/119-default-network-not-vpn.md)). Field report (MIUI Android 13): при Allow-list трафик выбранных приложений не работал, пока в список не добавить сам L×Box. Корень — запрос на `defaultNetwork` не требовал `NOT_VPN`, и на части прошивок `registerBestMatchingNetworkCallback` возвращал **сам VPN** как underlying-сеть → `local_dns_resolver` (`LocalResolver`) слал DNS обратно в tun (loop) → имена у allowed-приложений не резолвились. Добавлен `NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_VPN` → `defaultNetwork` всегда физическая underlying-сеть, **без** прописывания себя (self-add отклонён). Плюс постоянный диаг-лог `LxBoxNet` (`adb logcat -s LxBoxNet`: `iface` + `vpn=true/false`) — следующий такой репорт диагностируется мгновенно. Регрессии нет: где сеть уже была underlying (ColorOS/Pixel) — результат тот же.

## [2.0.6] — 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **§117 — DNS Rules: единый вид строк mirror-группы + тоггл DNS-аспекта правила** ([dns_mirror_group_card.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen/widgets/dns_mirror_group_card.dart), [dns_settings_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen.dart), [custom_rule.dart](app/lib/models/custom_rule.dart)). DNS-аспект пресета и DNS-опция обычного routing-правила в mirror-группе отображались по-разному (большая карточка со switch vs компактная read-only строка). Теперь оба — единый `DnsMirrorTile`: switch + превью `rule_set` + плашка-источник (`preset`/`rule`), тап → read-only превью эмитимого DNS-rule. Switch у rule-строки тогглит `cr.dns.enabled` (DNS-аспект гаснет, routing-часть правила живёт); выключенная строка остаётся видимой (серая) — включается обратно, симметрично пресету. Новый предикат `dnsMirrorEligible` (видимость строки, без `dns.enabled`); `dnsMirrorActive = eligible && dns.enabled` (эмиссия + lifecycle-локи серверов). Превью-тело — из реального эмиттера (`applyAllCustomRules`, force-active), тег `rule_set` совпадает с конфигом.
- **§117 (задача 4b) — Rename тега DNS-сервера с каскадом по ссылкам** ([dns_server_resolver.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen/dns_server_resolver.dart), [edit_controller.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_server_edit/edit_controller.dart)). Tag в редакторе был залочен при edit existing (защита от орфанов — на tag смотрят DNS-правила, DNS Final/Default Resolver, `domain_resolver` других серверов, DNS-опции routing-правил). Теперь переименовывать можно: save каскадно обновляет все ссылки (`renameDnsServerTagRefs` — §061-правила/resolvers/domain_resolver'ы/`dns_servers`-vars; `renameRuleDnsServerTag` — `dns.serverTag` routing-правил), коллизия с существующим тегом блокируется. Tag правится и в Params, и в JSON (синхронизированы). Примеры IP в форме — `192.168.1.1` (домашний роутер) вместо чужих живых адресов. +3 теста ([rename_refs_test.dart](app/test/screens/dns_settings_screen/rename_refs_test.dart)).

### Added

- **§118 — Идентичность фетча подписок: кастомный User-Agent + HWID** ([spec](docs/spec/tasks/118F-subscription-fetch-identity/spec.md), [subscription_identity.dart](app/lib/services/subscription/subscription_identity.dart), [sources.dart](app/lib/services/subscription/sources.dart), [subscriptions_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/app_settings_screen/widgets/subscriptions_tab.dart)). Новый таб **App Settings → Subscriptions** (между General и Diagnostics; авто-обновление переехало сюда из General). (1) **Custom User-Agent** — override дефолтного `LxBox-android/<ver>` на каждый GET подписки (с предупреждением: панели маршрутизируют конфиг по подстроке в UA — без токена `LxBox` можно получить неподдерживаемый формат, §114; per-source UA имеет приоритет). (2) **Send HWID** (off по умолчанию) — Remnawave-заголовки `x-hwid` (UUIDv4, генерится один раз при включении, Regenerate ↻) + device-meta `x-device-os`/`x-ver-os`/`x-device-model`; **все четыре переписываемые** (override > device-дефолт, пусто = дефолт). Var'ы `subscription_*` не config-significant (только фетч, не sing-box-конфиг). +7 тестов.

- **§117 (задача 4b) — Форма создания DNS-сервера: UDP / DoT / DoH** ([server_form_section.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_server_edit/sections/server_form_section.dart), [edit_controller.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_server_edit/edit_controller.dart)). Создание своего сервера требовало писать sing-box JSON руками — не экран создания. Теперь Params inline-сервера — структурная форма: переключатель режима **UDP / DoT / DoH** (порт-дефолты 53/853/443 — ключ `server_port` пишется только для нестандартных), адрес (для DoH принимает и URL-вставку `https://host/path` — разбирается на server+path), для DoH — path, для DoT/DoH — TLS SNI, для доменного адреса — автоматический **Domain resolver** (дропдаун существующих серверов, дефолт google_udp — решение №4; IP-адрес снимает ключ). Поля и JSON-вкладка редактируют одно тело с двусторонней синхронизацией; `tag` теперь виден в JSON как часть sing-box-тела (в new-режиме редактируется и там и в Params, при edit залочен с понятной ошибкой). Нераспознанный `type` (local, h3, …) — пометка «use JSON tab», форма не мешает. +10 тестов.

- **§117 (задача 4) — Полноэкранный редактор DNS-сервера (+ inline-detour)** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/117F-dns-rework/spec.md), [dns_server_edit_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_server_edit_screen.dart), [merged_server_tile.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen/widgets/merged_server_tile.dart)). UX DNS-серверов был фрагментирован: инлайн-тюнер на тайле + read-only диалог тела по тапу + боттом-шит редактирования + иконки edit/reset/delete. Теперь как у правил (`CustomRuleEditScreen`, паттерн 1:1): тап по тайлу → полноэкранный редактор с табами **Params** (Description/Enabled; template → var-редакторы, перенос тюнера; inline → Tag + пикер **Outbound (detour)**; preset → locked-пометка) и **JSON** (inline — редактируемое тело, источник правды; template/preset — read-only превью отрезолвленного тела + storage-shape + Copy). AppBar: back-guard Save/Keep/Discard, Reset-to-canonical (↺ для overridden), Delete (user-only, не locked), Save с dirty-подсветкой. Заодно закрыт **inline-detour**: у пользовательского сервера канал выбирается пикером и живёт в `body['detour']` (направление «канал исчез → ключ тихо не пишется» наследуется от задачи 2 даром). Тайл ужат до switch + title/badge; `server_editor_sheet`/server-body-диалог удалены. Модель/сторадж/эмиссия не тронуты. +11 тестов ([edit_controller_test.dart](app/test/screens/dns_server_edit/edit_controller_test.dart)).

### Added

- **§117 — Debug API: поле `dns` у `/rules` CRUD** ([rules.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/rules.dart)). Задача 3 добавила DNS-опцию в модель правила, но Debug API write-side её не знал — строгий парсер POST молча ронял поле. Теперь POST/PUT принимают `dns: {enabled, server_tag}` (`"dns": null` в PUT очищает), GET отдаёт ту же форму. Найдено на девайс-смоке §117.

- **§117 (задача 3) — Опция DNS у правила («DNS follows the rule»)** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/117F-dns-rework/spec.md), [custom_rule.dart](app/lib/models/custom_rule.dart), [custom_rules.dart](app/lib/services/builder/post_steps/custom_rules.dart), [dns_section.dart](app/lib/screens/custom_rule_edit/sections/dns_section.dart)). Финал переработки DNS: routing-правило само регистрирует DNS-правило на выбранный сервер — не нужно руками собирать тройку «routing-правило + DNS-сервер + DNS-правило». Модель: ортогональное поле `dns: {enabled, serverTag}` у inline/srs правил (типы правил не меняются, выбор сервера — из существующих по tag; backward-compat: нет поля → старое поведение). Эмиссия: **inline+dns** шарит свой headless rule_set между route- и DNS-правилом (no split); **srs+dns** ссылается на тот же `.srs`-тег + DNS-безопасные доп-фильтры; пропавший сервер → mirror тихо не эмитится (решение №3). Гейт: чекбокс серый при ports/protocols (headless их не выразит, порт/протокол неизвестны в момент DNS-запроса) — продублирован в build. Ордеринг (решение №6): DNS-mirror'ы эмитятся атомарной группой в порядке routing-правил, в DNS-настройках группа — одна карточка «From routing rules» (двигается целиком, внутрь не реордерится). Lifecycle (locked №7) расширен на правила: сервер, реферимый правилом с DNS — замок «used by <правило>», build force-include. Проверено `sing-box check` (lx.6): inline+dns и srs+dns конфиги валидны. +13 тестов ([rule_dns_mirror_test.dart](app/test/services/builder/rule_dns_mirror_test.dart)).

- **§117 (задачи 1+2) — Переменные у DNS-серверов: per-server detour/IP-профиль в UI** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/117F-dns-rework/spec.md), [wizard_template.json](app/assets/wizard_template.json), [dns_servers.dart](app/lib/services/builder/post_steps/dns_servers.dart), [merged_server_tile.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen/widgets/merged_server_tile.dart)). Field report (4PDA, Pixel 7): DNS-запросы «нужных» приложений должны ходить **через VPN-канал**, но detour у DNS-сервера в UI не управлялся — собиралось вручную из трёх кусков. Теперь: (1) **формат шаблона** — каждый сервер в `dns_options.servers` это обёртка `{description, enabled, vars, server}` с `@var`-плейсхолдерами в body (tag в `server.tag`); консолидация Quad9+AdGuard+AdGuard Family → один «Safe DNS» с `safe_profile`-enum, IPv4/IPv6 варианты через `dns_ip`-enum, доменные серверы получили `domain_resolver: "@dom_resolver"` (var `type: dns_servers`, default `google_udp`); (2) **build** — `resolveTemplateDnsServerBody` подставляет vars значениями юзера (storage-ref расширен `varValues`) или дефолтами; `detour` нормализуется: `direct-out` / исчезнувший канал → ключ **не пишется** (вместо dangling-ссылки), правило применяется ко всем серверам включая inline; (3) **UI** — у template-сервера разворачиваемая секция параметров (`TemplateVarListView` + новые типы `outbound` — пикер «Direct + активные каналы», и `dns_servers` — дропдаун тегов). Кейс репортёра: у adguard-сервера выбрать Outbound=VPN-канал → `detour: "<канал>"` → DNS уходит через туннель. Бонус-фикс жизненного цикла (pre-§117 баг): DNS-сервер, реферимый активным пресетом, больше нельзя выключить под DNS-правилом пресета (битый конфиг) — UI-замок «used by <пресет>» + build force-include. Миграции нет — kind-ref'ы + орфан-чистка + дефолты vars покрывают старое состояние. Проверено `sing-box check` (lx.6). +13 тестов ([dns_servers_resolver_test.dart](app/test/services/builder/dns_servers_resolver_test.dart)). Задача 3 (опция DNS у routing-правила) — отдельно.

### Fixed

- **DNS-тайлы: чип источника не рвётся на строки** ([dns_badge.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen/widgets/dns_badge.dart)). На крупном системном шрифте текст в плоском чипе (font 9, padding 2) переносился и вылезал из контейнера. Чип подрос (padding 8×4, font 10) и стал строго однострочным (`maxLines: 1` + fade).
- **DNS Rules: контент тайла больше не режется по высоте** ([dns_rule_tile.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen/widgets/dns_rule_tile.dart), [dns_mirror_group_card.dart](app/lib/screens/dns_settings_screen/widgets/dns_mirror_group_card.dart)). При переносе заголовка правила на 2 строки низ карточки обрезался (превью `rule_set: …` уезжало за край). Причина — `ListTile` под `IntrinsicHeight` (нужным только для растяжки grab-strip) занижает intrinsic-высоту и не учитывает перенос. Grab-strip переведён на `Stack` + `Positioned(top:0,bottom:0)`, `IntrinsicHeight` убран — тайл получает натуральную высоту по контенту.

## [2.0.5] — 2026-06-12

### Changed

- **§116 — Центральный banner-механизм + фикс ложного «config changed»** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/116-banner-mechanism-and-config-banner-fix.md), [app_banner.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/app_banner.dart), [config_io.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller/config_io.dart)). Field report (MIUI): правишь настройки → смахиваешь приложение из recents (VPN жив, замочек) → на старте висит «Config changed — restart VPN», хотя ничего не менялось; §113 этот кейс не закрыл. Причина глубже одного флага: `configChangedNeedRestart` ставился в `saveParsedConfig` без сравнения содержимого (`tunnelUp || prev`), а bootstrap на старте пересобирает конфиг по **двум** триггерам (`configDirty` ИЛИ `configRaw.isEmpty` — последний горит, когда `getConfig()` не вернул конфиг на холодном MIUI-старте), и любая пересборка при живом туннеле зажигала баннер. Фикс: (1) **дифф** в `saveParsedConfig` — пересобрал, конфиг совпал с работающим → не ставим «config changed» (canonical-to-canonical, кроет оба триггера); (2) bootstrap разнесён по `tunnelUp`: нет конфига + туннель выключен → собрать молча; нет конфига + туннель жив → **постоянная плашка «Config loading error»** (рестарт), без пересборки; реальный `configDirty` → пересобрать. Параллельно — **единый banner-механизм**: три захардкоженных инлайн-плашки (`configDirty`/`configChangedNeedRestart`/`lastError`) + новая `config_load_error` сведены в декларативную проекцию состояния `activeBanners` + `BannerStack` (модель `autoDismiss: Duration?`, централизованный 15с-таймер lastError вместо размазанного в `_onControllerChange`); расширяется новым источником одной строкой-guard. SnackBar'ы (`ScaffoldMessenger`) — вне скоупа (event vs state). +9 тестов ([app_banner_test.dart](app/test/screens/app_banner_test.dart)).

### Fixed

- **§115 — VLESS flow: honor ссылку, не навязывать vision** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/115-vless-flow-honor-link.md), [vless_parser.dart](app/lib/services/parser/uri_parsers/vless_parser.dart), [json_parsers.dart](app/lib/services/parser/json_parsers.dart)). Field report: на панели x3-ui `flow: none`, но LxBox после импорта проставлял в конфиг `"flow": "xtls-rprx-vision"` → клиент слал vision, сервер не ждал → нет подключения. Причина — перенесённый из v1 эвристик-костыль: «REALITY на голом TCP без flow ⇒ наверняка vision, допишем». Предположение неверно — REALITY штатно работает и без vision (`flow: none` валиден), а нормальные x-ui/x3-ui share-ссылки vision прописывают явно. Теперь `flow` берётся из ссылки как есть: нет flow → поле не пишется → plain VLESS, совпадает с сервером. Плюс защита от обратного: `xtls-rprx-vision` валиден только на bare TLS — с любым транспортом (ws/grpc/**xhttp**) несовместим (XHTTP+Vision — protocol limitation ядра), поэтому на **эмиссии** (`emitVless`/`toUriVless`) flow пишется только если он **ровно** `xtls-rprx-vision` И транспорта нет — универсальный net на все пути (URI/Xray/raw sing-box JSON/manual). Любое прочее значение (включая литеральный `flow=none` из ссылки и deprecated `xtls-rprx-direct/origin/splice`) поле не пишет — иначе ядро отвергало конфиг как мусорный flow. Проверено `sing-box check` ядром lx.6: VLESS+XHTTP+Reality, bare-TCP-без-flow и `flow=none` конфиги грузятся. +13 тестов ([vless_test.dart](app/test/parser/vless_test.dart), [json_parsers_test.dart](app/test/parser/json_parsers_test.dart)).

- **§114 — User-Agent подписок: брендинг `LxBox-android`** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/114-subscription-user-agent-rebrand.md), [user_agent.dart](app/lib/services/subscription/user_agent.dart), [sources.dart](app/lib/services/subscription/sources.dart)). Часть subscription-панелей (Remnawave/Marzban-типа) маршрутизирует тело ответа по подстроке в `User-Agent`: опознанному клиенту отдают base64/URI-список (его ест парсер v2), неопознанному (в частности UA с голым `singbox` без дефиса) — полный sing-box JSON-конфиг или заглушку, которые парсер не переваривает, и добавление падает/крашится. Android слал `LxBox Android subscription client`. Теперь UA брендирован: `LxBox-android/<appVersion>` (например `LxBox-android/2.0.4`), резолвится из PackageInfo. Инварианты: бренд начинается с `LxBox-android/`, голого `singbox` нет нигде, токена `sing-box` и платформенного комментария нет вовсе. Подтверждено curl'ом против боевой панели vern13 (новый UA → base64 vless-список, не JSON). +6 тестов ([user_agent_test.dart](app/test/subscription/user_agent_test.dart)).

## [2.0.4] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **§113 — Ложный баннер «config changed» после kill приложения** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/113-false-config-changed-banner.md), [settings_storage.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage.dart), [config_dirty_check.dart](app/lib/services/config_dirty_check.dart)). Field report (4PDA): правишь Tunnel apps, смахиваешь приложение из recents, запускаешь — вверху красный «config changed, restart VPN», хотя ничего не менялось. Причина: §107 инвертировал порядок дисковых записей (конфиг пишется на возврате к home, настройки — позже на `dispose`), из-за чего `settings.mtime > config.mtime` стало нормой после **любой** правки — а bootstrap mtime-compare читал это как «грязно». Пока процесс жив, флаг в памяти снят пересборкой; swipe убивает процесс → флаг передеривается из mtime и врёт. Фикс двойной: (а) `configDirty` переехал в `SettingsStorage` (объект, где меняются настройки) — config-значимые сейверы сами поднимают флаг, «поменять настройку, не пометив» стало структурно невозможно; (б) при записи настроек со снятым флагом `_save` выравнивает mtime конфига к mtime настроек (`touchConfig`), сравнение mtime — с секундной резолюцией. Без диффа содержимого (сознательно — чтобы аномалии были видны). Не затрагивает реальные правки (баннер показывается как было). +6 тестов [config_dirty_flag_test.dart](app/test/services/config_dirty_flag_test.dart).

## [2.0.3] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **§112 — AWG ranged magic headers (`h1`–`h4` как диапазон `N-M`)** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/112-awg-ranged-magic-headers.md), [node_spec.dart](app/lib/models/node_spec.dart)). Живые awg2-экспорты несут magic headers нового формата AWG 2.0 — `H1 = 43613244-384550127`; модель §097 держала h-поля как `int`, диапазон молча выпадал на парсе, и handshake тихо не проходил (клиент слал WG-дефолтные типы пакетов). Теперь `h1`–`h4` принимают «число-или-диапазон» во всех трёх входах (URI query / INI `[Interface]` / sing-box JSON, включая `vpn://`-импорт §110): одиночное значение остаётся `int` (строка-число нормализуется), диапазон хранится строкой и эмитится JSON string — контракт ядра. Глубокая валидация (uint32, start ≤ end, непересечение) сознательно оставлена ядру — оно даёт явную ошибку на старте вместо молчаливого drop'а. Ядро перепинено `v1.13.13-lx.5` → **`v1.13.13-lx.6`** ([libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version), core-часть — sing-box-lx SPECS/005): старое ядро не анмаршалит строковые `h*`. +7 тестов ([awg_test.dart](app/test/parser/awg_test.dart), [amnezia_link_test.dart](app/test/parser/amnezia_link_test.dart)).

- **§111 — Detour для подписок без родных detour-серверов** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/111-subscription-detour-without-native-chain.md), [subscription_settings_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/subscription_detail_screen/widgets/subscription_settings_tab.dart)). Секция «Detour» на Settings tab подписки показывалась только при наличии родных detour-цепочек у нод — подписке с плоским списком серверов detour прописать было негде, хотя builder (APPEND, §073) уже умеет 1-hop на пустой цепочке. Теперь для таких подписок показывается компактный пикер «Detour server» поверх тех же полей `DetourPolicy`: выбранный сервер прописывается всем нодам подписки (`"detour": "<tag>"`), без неприменимых radio-режимов/register-тоглов. Плюс fix: пикер ставит `useDetourServers=true` при непустом выборе — leftover-состояние «mode был None» молча гасило override в builder'е.

- **§110 — Импорт Amnezia `vpn://`-ссылок** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/110-amnezia-vpn-link-import.md), [amnezia_link.dart](app/lib/services/parser/amnezia_link.dart)). Контейнерный share-формат Amnezia/awg2 (`.vpn`-файл = та же строка) теперь распознаётся при вставке в Subscriptions «+»: `vpn://` + base64url(qCompress(JSON)) декодится (включая несжатый fallback и padded base64), из `containers[]` берутся все WG/AWG контейнеры (`last_config.config` → существующий INI-парс §097/§106, `$PRIMARY_DNS`/`$SECONDARY_DNS` подставляются из `dns1`/`dns2`), не-WG контейнеры скипаются. Один `UserServer` на ссылку, `rawBody` хранит оригинал — персист ре-парсит тем же путём. Анти-zlib-бомба: ссылка ≤ 64 KiB, claimed size ≤ 4 MiB. Карточка вставки показывает endpoint и число контейнеров. +20 тестов [amnezia_link_test.dart](app/test/parser/amnezia_link_test.dart).

### Fixed

- **§109 — Tunnel apps: установленные приложения помечались «uninstalled, auto-skipped»** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/109-tun-apps-false-uninstalled.md), [app_info_cache.dart](app/lib/services/app_info_cache.dart), [VpnPlugin.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/VpnPlugin.kt)). Таймаут (5s) и ошибка канала в `getAppInfo` кэшировались как «не установлено» без ретраев: при открытии таба запросы по всему списку стреляют разом, native отвечает по одному на main thread, и каждый ответ тащил PNG-encode иконки — на медленных устройствах с длинным списком хвост очереди стабильно помечался «удалённым» до перезапуска приложения (field report, 4PDA). Метка была косметической (в tun пакеты уходили корректно — `include_package` собирается из настроек, мимо этого кэша), но текст «auto-skipped» уводил диагностику в ложный след. Теперь: native явно различает «не установлено» (`NameNotFoundException` → `{"notFound": true}`) и сбой проверки (retryable error); сорвавшаяся проверка не кэшируется и ретраится (2s/5s/15s); иконка убрана из `getAppInfo` — метаданные мгновенные, иконка дотягивается отдельным `getAppIcon`; метка рисуется только при подтверждённом not-found. +9 тестов ([app_info_cache_test.dart](app/test/services/app_info_cache_test.dart), [box_vpn_client_test.dart](app/test/vpn/box_vpn_client_test.dart)).

## [2.0.2] — 2026-06-10

Patch: §107 — изменения настроек (правила роутинга, DNS, tunnel apps, core
vars) не попадали в конфиг: пересборка на возврате к home читала состояние
«до последней правки», и рестарт туннеля не помогал (регрессия §076
lazy-persist, v1.9.0+; field report с 4PDA). Release notes:
[docs/releases/v2.0.2.md](docs/releases/v2.0.2.md).

### Fixed

- **§107 — Rebuild на возврате к home читал несфлашенный storage** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/107-lazy-persist-stale-read-race.md), [lazy_persist_mixin.dart](app/lib/screens/lazy_persist_mixin.dart), [settings_storage.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage.dart)). `didPop` срабатывает в момент pop'а, а write-on-exit flush экрана — после exit-анимации (~300 мс позже): конфиг хронически собирался из состояния «до последней правки» (отставал на один визит editing-экрана), Start/restart не помогали — на диске лежал stale `singbox_config.json`. Симптом: «поменял правила → нет трафика, лечится только танцем с Tunnel Applications». Теперь каждая мутация staged в in-memory кэш сразу (`setX(..., flush: false)`), на dispose/paused остаётся только атомарный `flushToDisk()` — любой читатель (rebuild, гейт на Start, bootstrap) видит свежие данные. Затронуты все lazy-экраны: routing, DNS, tunnel apps, core vars. +7 тестов [settings_storage_staging_test.dart](app/test/services/settings_storage_staging_test.dart).
- **§107 — Start при pending-изменениях достраивает конфиг перед запуском** ([home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). Гейт в `_startWithAutoRefresh`: незавершённая пересборка await'ится (single-flight), `configDirty` → rebuild до native start. Туннель всегда поднимается со свежими правилами; плашка «restart to apply» остаётся только для сбоя сборки / config-lock (§037).
- **§107 — Ошибка пересборки больше не гасит баннер**. `configDirty` сбрасывается только при успешном generate+save (раньше — безусловно, и юзер не узнавал, что конфиг остался старым); при неудачном save флаг восстанавливается.
- **§107 — Триггер rebuild не теряется при busy**. Возврат на home во время фонового fetch'а раньше молча скипал пересборку; теперь one-shot listener догоняет её, когда controller освободится.
- **§108 — AppPicker: системный back больше не теряет выбор приложений** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/108-app-picker-back-loses-selection.md), [app_picker_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/app_picker_screen.dart)). В пикере приложений (Tunnel Applications → Add) результат возвращала только стрелка в AppBar; системный «назад»/жест проходил через пустой `PopScope` (canPop=true) — роут попался с `result=null`, и выбор молча выкидывался. Жил с §017. Теперь back перехватывается (`canPop: false`) и возвращает селекцию, как стрелка. +2 теста [app_picker_pop_test.dart](app/test/screens/app_picker_pop_test.dart).

### Removed

- **§107 — Настройка «Auto-rebuild config» удалена** (App Settings → General, ключ `auto_rebuild`). Пересборка на возврате к home теперь всегда автоматическая — корректность конфига на старте гарантирует гейт, OFF-режим потерял смысл. Stale-ключ вычищается из storage автоматически.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-06-10

Patch: два бага парсинга WireGuard / AmneziaWG (репорт из desktop,
воспроизведены в LxBox). Release notes: [docs/releases/v2.0.1.md](docs/releases/v2.0.1.md).

### Fixed

- **§106 — Private key с сырым `/` больше не ломает ноду** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/106-wireguard-slash-key-and-bare-cidr.md), [uri_utils.dart](app/lib/services/parser/uri_utils.dart), [wireguard_parser.dart](app/lib/services/parser/uri_parsers/wireguard_parser.dart)). `wireguard://`/`awg://`-ссылка, у которой base64 private key содержит сырой `/` (`wireguard://FgFc1x9371GE/DV6bE…@host`), не парсилась: `Uri.tryParse` принимал `/` за начало path, терял ключ → нода отклонялась с «missing private key». Симптом — сервер виден в **Sources**, но пропадает из **Preview / all servers**. Теперь сырой `/` percent-энкодится **только в userInfo-части** до парсинга (уже-`%2F` не затрагиваются, query вроде `address=10.0.0.2/32` — тоже). *Workaround на старых сборках: заменить `/` на `%2F` в ключе.*
- **§106 — Bare-адрес без `/32` больше не мешает старту ядра** ([json_parsers.dart](app/lib/services/parser/json_parsers.dart)). WireGuard/AmneziaWG-нода, у которой `address` (или элемент `allowed_ips`) — голый IP без CIDR-префикса (`172.16.0.2` вместо `172.16.0.2/32`, частый вид в AmneziaWG `.conf`-экспортах), давала `config.json`, который ядро отказывалось грузить: `netip.ParsePrefix("172.16.0.2"): no '/'`. Теперь bare IPv4 дефолтится в `/32`, bare IPv6 — в `/128`, для `address` и `allowed_ips`, во всех входах (URI / INI / JSON). +тесты [wireguard_edge_test.dart](app/test/parser/wireguard_edge_test.dart).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-10

Мажорный релиз: bundled-ядро сменено на собственный fork
[`sing-box-lx`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx) **v1.13.13-lx.5**
(AmneziaWG 2.0 + нативный XHTTP) + переработанные фильтры главного экрана.
Release notes: [docs/releases/v2.0.0.md](docs/releases/v2.0.0.md).

### Added

- **§105 — Support message («поддержи автора», remote-managed)** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/105F-support-message/spec.md), [support_message.dart](app/lib/services/support/support_message.dart)). При открытии HOME — когда туннель активен ≥5 мин (пользователь реально пользуется) и суммарно отработал ≥3 часов — приложение показывает диалог с просьбой поддержать проект (звёзды GitHub-репам, 4PDA, донат). Контент — `docs/support.json` через raw.githubusercontent (паттерн §036): текст/ссылки/пороги правятся без релиза; смена `id` = новая кампания. Удачный fetch кэшируется (офлайн-показ); «Позже» → повтор через +10ч **активного** времени, «Не показывать» → навсегда для кампании. Состояние — отдельный `support_state.json` (не `lxbox_settings.json` — минутные флаши счётчика не дирявят §076 configDirty). +11 тестов.

- **§097 — AmneziaWG / AWG2 + нативный XHTTP (ядро `sing-box-lx`)** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/097F-awg2-amneziawg2/spec.md), [node_spec.dart](app/lib/models/node_spec.dart), [transport_spec.dart](app/lib/models/transport_spec.dart)). Сквозная поддержка fork-ядра [`Leadaxe/sing-box-lx`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx) (база sing-box 1.13.13, build-теги `with_awg` + `with_xhttp`):
  - **AWG / AWG2 (AmneziaWG 2.0) end-to-end**: endpoint-level поля обфускации WireGuard — `jc`/`jmin`/`jmax` (jitter), `s1`–`s4` (packet split), `h1`–`h4` (magic headers), `i1`–`i5` (CPS decoy, v2.0) — парсятся из всех трёх входов (`wireguard://` URI query, INI `[Interface]`, sing-box JSON endpoint), хранятся в `WireguardSpec.awg` (`null` = plain WG) и round-trip'ятся через emit (config + share-URI). Числа эмитятся как JSON numbers (type-fidelity), регистр `i*`-строк сохраняется; битое число в URI (`jc=abc`) → поле пропущено, парс не падает. +10 тестов [awg_test.dart](app/test/parser/awg_test.dart).
  - **Алиас `awg://`** — распознаётся и парсером (dispatcher → WG-путь), и `isDirectLink` (input-detect в Subscriptions «+»).
  - **MTU-кламп 1280 для AWG-нод** (parse-time, helper `awgClampMtu` в [uri_utils.dart](app/lib/services/parser/uri_utils.dart)): нет `mtu` → 1280 (вместо WG-дефолта 1408); `mtu>1280` → кламп + debug-лог; явно меньший — уважаем. 1280 = рекомендованный клиентский MTU самой AmneziaWG и минимальный IPv6 MTU — безопасно на любом пути; завышение даёт тихий облом «handshake есть, данных нет». **Plain WG не затронут** (1408/1420 как раньше). Persisted-ноды накрыты автоматически (`UserServer.fromJson` re-parse'ит из rawBody).
  - **XHTTP — нативный transport** (Xray «splithttp»): `XhttpTransport` расширен (`mode`/`x_padding_bytes`/`no_grpc_header`/`headers`) и эмитит `type:"xhttp"` напрямую — **fallback в httpupgrade и `UnsupportedTransportWarning` убраны**. Parse: URI (camelCase Xray + snake sing-box), sing-box JSON, Xray `xhttpSettings`. `httpupgrade` остаётся отдельным типом. +8 тестов [xhttp_test.dart](app/test/parser/xhttp_test.dart).
  - **Ядро сменено**: bundled libbox → fork `sing-box-lx` `v1.13.13-lx.5` (build-теги `with_awg`/`with_xhttp`) — AWG/AWG2 и XHTTP работают end-to-end из коробки; Kotlin-мост (`VpnPlugin`/`BoxService`) совместим без правок. Подключение закреплено §104: пин версии в [libbox.version](app/android/libbox.version) + [fetch-libbox.sh](scripts/fetch-libbox.sh) (скачивает AAR из GH Releases форка с проверкой SHA256; вызывается из `build-local-apk.sh` и из CI — шаг «Fetch sing-box-lx core» в android-job); Maven-зависимость стокового `libbox 1.13.11` удалена из `build.gradle.kts`, `libs/` остаётся в `.gitignore`.

- **§095 — Filter mode: фильтр-панель → рабочая зона с табами** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/095-filter-mode-workspace.md), [filter_panel.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/filter_panel.dart), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). Открытый фильтр больше не съедает экран (~430px → ~150–230px, +4–6 видимых рядов нод):
  - При открытой панели **скрываются** стат-полоса (TrafficBar) и хедер «Nodes (N)» — строка поиска поднимается наверх, рядом ✕ закрытия (ровно там, где была кнопка `Icons.tune`). Channel-dropdown + Stop/Connected остаются. NODES-строка теперь видна только при `tunnelUp && фильтр закрыт` (в STOP-режиме нод нет — фильтровать нечего).
  - **Табы** Regex · Protocol · Subscribes · Settings (рендерится только активный — авто-высота). Regex-поле и эмодзи-чипы — на вкладке Regex; тап по эмодзи-чипу теперь **тогл** (повторный тап убирает эмодзи из OR-паттерна, выбранные подсвечены). Ping + Show-detour + Show-non-matching — на Settings.
  - **Сводка активных фильтров чипами** (горизонтальный скролл, лейблы ≤15 симв.): tap по чипу → его таб, ✕ → снять фильтр. Visibility-тоглы тоже видны чипами (⚙-перечёркнут = detour скрыт; visibility_off = non-matching скрыты).
  - **Янтарные точки** «фильтр применён» — на закрытой кнопке `Icons.tune` и на табах с активным фильтром.
  - Ping-фильтр **пре-заполнен реальным редактируемым `200`** (раньше серый hint, читавшийся как установленное значение); чекбокс OFF — фильтр неактивен, пока юзер не включит (не прячет непропингованные ноды при первом открытии).
  - Синтетический chip подписки **«Custom» убран** (путал; custom-ноды видны без фильтра подписки и скрываются при фильтре по конкретной подписке — predicate не менялся).

- **§096 / §093 G2b — Единый `!`-negate во всех фильтрах + detour tri-state** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/096-unified-negate-toggle.md), [node_filter.dart](app/lib/screens/home/node_filter.dart), [node_filter_view_model.dart](app/lib/screens/home/node_filter_view_model.dart)). У каждой категории фильтра — ведущая иконка-тогл `!` (серая = обычный match, красная = инверсия NOT): Regex / Protocol / Subscribes («НЕ из выбранных»). Predicate унифицирован — fail когда `member == invert`; новые поля `protocolsInvert`/`subscriptionsInvert` запоминаются per-channel (§083).
  - **Detour-фильтр → tri-state** (чекбокс-enable + независимый `!`, заменил тогл «Show detour»): чекбокс ВЫКЛ (старт) = показать всё; ВКЛ + `!` = скрыть detour; ВКЛ без `!` = **только detour** — диагностический кейс «чистый список релеев» при разборе разрыва цепочки. Лейбл ряда динамический (Show all / Hide / Only) и следует за `!`. Это **pool**-фильтр (физически убирает ноды из списка), глобальный (не per-channel); control-узлы (selector/urltest/direct/…) никогда не отсеиваются — auto/direct не исчезают. Сводка-чип: ⚙ (только detour) / ⊘ (скрыт).
  - **Regex-enable убран**: regex активен, пока поле непустое (выключение = очистка ✕); слот галки занял `!`.
  - **Register-detour-тогглы в режиме Add detour (APPEND)** (закрывает §093 G2b, [subscription_settings_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/subscription_detail_screen/widgets/subscription_settings_tab.dart)): тогглы `registerDetourServers` / `registerDetourInAuto` теперь показываются не только под Use, но и под Add detour при APPEND (Replace выкл — нативные детуры подписки остаются в цепочке и политики имеют смысл); прячутся при REPLACE/None. Кейс юзера: «добавить свой detour, не заменяя детуры подписки». Политики остаются subscription-level (`DetourPolicy`) — решение варианта (b), флаги хранятся независимо от режима. UI-only, данные/билдер не менялись.
  - Тесты: +invert-группы в node_filter / channel_filters / view-model + NEW [node_list_presenter_test.dart](app/test/screens/home/node_list_presenter_test.dart) (pool × isDetour × показать-всё/hide/only × control-bypass).

- **§103 — Variant-фильтр: чипы transport/security + eager-лейблы** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/103-variant-filter-chips.md), [node_filter.dart](app/lib/screens/home/node_filter.dart), [filter_panel.dart](app/lib/screens/home/widgets/filter_panel.dart)). На вкладке Protocol под протоколами — вторая строка чипов с вариантами §102: транспорты `tcp/ws/grpc/h2/httpupgrade/quic/xhttp` + security `TLS/TLS+Vision/Reality/Reality+Vision/awg/awg2`, вперемешку, с собственным `!`-negate (§096-семантика) и per-channel памятью (§083). Member = пересечение тегов ноды с выбором (микс OR); нода без распознанных вариантов при активном фильтре — non-matching (locked decision #12). Словарь чипов собирается из текущего пула (канонический порядок: транспорты → security), urltest-fallback как у протоколов. Точка на табе = `protocolActive || variantActive`. Бонус: `transportLabel`/`securityLabel` теперь **eager** `final`-поля `ConfigNode` — деривятся один раз в `ParsedConfig.parse`, itemBuilder читает готовое (вся derivation в одном месте).

- **§098 — Drag-reorder подписок + единый grab-strip** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/098-reorder-subscriptions-and-unify-dns.md), [reorder_grab_strip.dart](app/lib/widgets/reorder_grab_strip.dart) NEW, [subscriptions_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/subscriptions_screen.dart)). Подписки в Subscriptions screen теперь переставляются drag'ом (контроллер умел `moveEntry` давно — звался только из Debug API; порядок персистится сразу, конфиг подхватит при следующем generate — тот же паттерн, что toggle). Drag-аффорданс унифицирован: общий виджет `ReorderGrabStrip` (вертикальная полоса с `drag_indicator`, эталон — routing rules) теперь у routing-правил, DNS-правил и подписок; у DNS убрана мелкая inline-иконка `drag_handle`. В node-list ручной сортировки (§071/§100) — **видимая** полоса в режиме `manual` (immediate drag), в остальных режимах прежний transparent strip + long-press (drag → переключение в manual). Drag только за полосу — long-press по телу строки остаётся контекстным меню; pull-to-refresh сохранён.

- **§083 — Per-channel match-filter memory (in-session)** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/083-per-channel-filter-memory.md), [channel_filters.dart](app/lib/screens/home/channel_filters.dart), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). Match-фильтры (regex / протоколы / подписки / ping) теперь запоминаются **отдельно для каждого канала** (selector group). Переключил канал → его набор фильтров восстанавливается; вернулся обратно → снова виден. Раньше фильтры были одни глобальные на все каналы. Реализация: `Map<channel → ChannelFilters>` snapshot в памяти, save/restore в `_onControllerChange` при смене `selectedGroup` (покрывает все пути — dropdown, connect-time resolve, applyGroup). `show-detour` / `show-dimmed` остаются глобальными (они про отображение, не про поиск). Без записи на диск (per-session, по запросу юзера). Pending debounce отменяется при смене канала (старый ввод не протекает). +12 unit tests на `ChannelFilters`.

- **§090 G2b / §094 — Эмодзи-теги серверов + вкладки в настройках ноды** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/094-emoji-tags-node-settings-tabs.md)). Настройки одиночного сервера теперь на двух вкладках — **Settings** (Protocol / Server / Tag + кнопка эмодзи-пикера) и **JSON** (редактируемый outbound на своей вкладке). Эмодзи-пикер (🏠 ⚡ 🚀 🔁 ⚙ ⭐ 🌍 🔒) — в настройках ноды и в форме создания (SOCKS). При создании сервера дефолтный эмодзи подставляется по протоколу (🔁 локальный · 🏠 WireGuard · 🚀 UDP/QUIC · ⚡ TCP), если в имени его нет. Ручная ⚙-пометка «detour» убрана — detour теперь структурный (см. §091 / G2a).
- **§090 G1 — «Later» в плашке обновления** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/092-update-dismiss-wire.md)). Кнопка «Later» в snackbar'е про новую версию скрывает этот релиз (не всплывает до следующего). Раньше read-guard был, но кнопки скрытия в UI не было.

### Changed

- **§100 — Manual-сортировка: выбор из меню + персист порядка** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/100-manual-sort-selectable-and-persisted.md), [home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart), [home_menus.dart](app/lib/screens/home/home_menus.dart)). Расширение §070/§071:
  - В sort-меню добавлен ряд `ChoiceChip` по всем режимам — Default / Ping / A–Z / **Custom**; выбор Custom включает manual → появляются видимые grab-strip'ы перетаскивания (§098). `NodeSortMode.next` теперь циклит **все 4** режима tap'ом по sort-кнопке (раньше manual обходился и входился только drag'ом).
  - **Режим сортировки и ручной порядок персистятся** (`node_sort_mode` + `node_manual_order` в `lxbox_settings.json`, новые `SettingsStorage.getNodeSort`/`setNodeSort`) и восстанавливаются на старте; stale-теги отфильтровываются, новые ноды — в конец (§071-механика). Отменяет §071-поведение «выход из manual сбрасывает manualOrder» — порядок теперь sticky, повторный выбор Custom его восстанавливает. Pin/re-sort остаются per-session.

- **§102 — Subtitle ноды: `протокол · транспорт · security`** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/102-subtitle-transport-variant.md), [config_node.dart](app/lib/models/config_node.dart)). Подзаголовок ряда ноды показывал только протокол — теперь три слота (пустые опускаются): **транспорт** из конфига (`tcp`/`ws`/`grpc`/`h2`/`httpupgrade`/`quic`/`xhttp`; sing-box `http` ≙ H2 → `h2`; без transport-блока → `tcp` для v2ray-протоколов, `null` для протоколов со встроенным транспортом) и **security** (`Reality` > `TLS`; суффикс `+Vision` при `flow=xtls-rprx-vision`; для WireGuard — уровень обфускации: `awg` при jc/jmin/jmax+s1/s2+h1–h4, `awg2` при s3/s4 и/или CPS i1–i5, пусто = plain WG). Примеры: `VLESS·tcp·Reality`, `VLESS·xhttp·TLS`, `VLESS·ws`, `TROJAN·tcp·TLS`, `Hy2·TLS`, `WG·awg2`, `WG`. Все три слота берутся с **одного** узла (сам tag или urltest-выбор, §048 fallback). Layout NodeRow не менялся (label нефиксированной ширины, `→ node` уступает место).

- **§099 — Copy-JSON переехал из контекстного меню ноды в View JSON** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/099-copy-json-into-view-json.md), [outbound_view_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/outbound_view_screen.dart), [node_row.dart](app/lib/widgets/node_row.dart)). Long-press меню ноды разгружено: убраны `Copy server (JSON)` / `Copy detour` / `Copy server + detour` (остался `Copy URI` — это ссылка, не JSON). Взамен Copy-кнопка в AppBar экрана View JSON стала умной: **нет detour** → простая Copy (`Copy server JSON`); **есть detour** → выпадашка `Copy server JSON` / `Copy detour` / **`Copy server + detours(N)`** — с количеством хопов для multi-hop цепочек. Логика копирования (`copyNodeJson` server/detour/both) переиспользована без изменений.

- **§090 G2a — Detour-фильтр по факту ссылок** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/093-detour-by-isdetour.md)). Тогл «Show detour» на главном теперь прячет/показывает ноды по тому, **используются ли они реально как хоп** (на них ссылаются через `detour` — `ConfigNode.isDetour`), а не по ручной ⚙-метке. «Detour-сервер» = релей, через который ходят другие ноды. (В §096 тогл развился в tri-state: чекбокс-enable + `!` — скрыть / только detour, см. Added.)
- **§090 A1 / A2 — Дедуп форматтеров** (`format_utils`). `formatBytes` ×4 → канон (`clash_api_client` байт-в-байт; `subscription_detail` → консистентно `0 B` / `500 B`); `formatDuration` получил флаг `daysRollup` (свернул `traffic_bar._uptime`). connections_screen оставлен (намеренно компактный). Поведение сохранено / уточнено.
- **§091 — `ConfigNode` модель: структурная мета ноды вместо reverse-parse тега** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/091-config-node-model.md), [config_node.dart](app/lib/models/config_node.dart)). `config-tag == нода в Clash`; протокол и `detour` лежат в конфиге по тегу → достаются без reverse-map. Новый `ConfigNode{tag, type, kind, detour, isMarkedDetour, detourRefCount, raw}` + контейнер `ParsedConfig` (parsed раз на смену `configRaw`) **схлопнул** три раздельные ре-деривации: `ConfigCache.protoByTag`/`detourTags`, `ConfigIntrospection` (удалён) и reverse-map `subscriptionsOfTag`. **Фильтр подписок теперь prefix-based** (`tag.startsWith('$prefix ')`): подписки без префикса не фильтруются (их ноды → «Custom»), chip только для подписок с префиксом — UI больше **не reverse-парсит** display-тег, поэтому целый **класс багов §077/§079/§080 закрыт структурно**. Behavior-change (по согласованию: «префикс не задан → нет поиска»). Динамика (пинги/active/urltest) — отдельный слой, джойнится на рендере. Реализация в 3 фазы (model → migrate → prefix-filter), каждая с analyze-clean + тест-гейтом; adversarial-verify (6 агентов) поймал 2 дивергенции — обе разобраны (empty-type proto-chip починен, foreign-node prefix-collision задокументирован). +20 тестов; удалён `TagResolver.matchesAllocated`.

- **§089 — Глубокий рефакторинг «монстров» (структурный, поведение неизменно)** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/089-deep-refactor-no-monsters.md)). Разбор крупных файлов на слои/виджеты/хелперы без изменения поведения; каждый шаг — `flutter analyze` clean + 808 тестов green. Пройдено: `home_screen` 2370→1664 (вынесены TrafficBar / StatusChip / ProgressBanner / NodesHeader / HomeDrawer / AddServerCta + меню/диалоги), и 6 экранов параллельным multi-agent воркфлоу (worktree-изоляция + adversarial behavioral-equivalence verify): `per_app_trace_tab` 1662→446, `dns_settings_screen` 1388→592, `routing_screen` 1219→598, `subscription_detail_screen` 1080→430, `app_settings_screen` 982→516, `subscriptions_screen` 967→445. Логика 1:1 сохранена (verify поймал и отсёк §080-регрессию в одном из проходов). Второй батч: `stats_screen` 683→294, `live_events_tab` 663→371, `backup_screen` 627→229, и сервисы `settings_storage` 941→411, `uri_parsers` 729→65, `post_steps` 1132→29 (последние два — barrel-реэкспорт). Третий/четвёртый батчи (контроллеры/VPN-клиент): `home_controller` 1089→585, `subscription_controller` 768→599, `box_vpn_client` 607→501, `traffic_profiler` 1632→1221 (частичный — монолитный singleton). **`home_screen` 2370→518** (NodeList-ядро → `NodeListPresenter` с frozen-sort кэшем + виджеты node_list/filter_panel/home_controls + диалоги). **P6 cross-cutting cleanup:** мёртвый код (`download_saver`, неиспользуемый barrel `debug_server`, 3 unused-символа), дедуп deep-copy/clone/equals в общий `services/json_clone.dart` (схлопнул `_deepCopy`/`_deepClone`/`_deepEquals` из 5 файлов builder/backup), ~24 §089-breadcrumb-комментария убраны (load-bearing WHY сохранены) + осиротевшие §081-ссылки. **P7:** полный overhaul `ARCHITECTURE.md` — 4-слойная диаграмма зон ответственности, дерево исходников с per-file ролями (включая native Kotlin), принцип «cohesion over line-count», §091-указатель. Итог §089: 16 из 18 монстров раздроблены; задокументированные исключения (cohesion > line-count) — `traffic_profiler` 1221 (монолитный singleton), `custom_rule` 618 (→§090, behavior-changing), `VpnPlugin.kt` 635 (единый channel-контракт). Поведение неизменно: `flutter analyze` clean + 808 тестов green на каждом шаге.

- **§085 R3 — `NodeFilterViewModel` (разбор God-object home_screen)** ([roadmap](docs/spec/tasks/085-architecture-roadmap.md), [node_filter_view_model.dart](app/lib/screens/home/node_filter_view_model.dart)). Весь node-filter state (regex / протоколы / подписки / ping + show-detour / show-non-matching + §083 per-channel память + debounce-таймеры) — 17 полей + 11 методов — вынесен из `_HomeScreenState` в отдельный `ChangeNotifier`. **home_screen похудел 2639 → 2370 строк** (−269). Бонус: хелперы `_buildNodeFilter` + `_splitNodes` убрали дублированную NodeFilter-конструкцию (был §078). +17 unit-tests (filter-логика раньше не была покрыта вообще). Adversarial review по 3 осям (behavioral equivalence / listener wiring / split helpers) — 0 findings. Поведение без изменений.

- **§085 R4 — `LazyPersistMixin` (общая §076 lazy write-on-exit машинерия)** ([roadmap](docs/spec/tasks/085-architecture-roadmap.md), [lazy_persist_mixin.dart](app/lib/screens/lazy_persist_mixin.dart)). Из arch-анализа: lazy-persist скелет (`_pendingChanges` + flush-on-dispose/paused + `configDirty` sync) был byte-for-byte продублирован в 4 экранах. Вынесен в mixin (`markDirty`/`persistChanges`). Применён к `tun_apps_tab`, `dns_settings_screen`, `routing_screen`. `settings_screen` (Map-семантика) оставлен с пометкой. +4 widget-tests (lazy-persist раньше не покрыт). Поведение без изменений.

- **§085 R2 — `ConfigIntrospection` (единый config-traversal service)** ([roadmap](docs/spec/tasks/085-architecture-roadmap.md), [config_introspection.dart](app/lib/services/config_introspection.dart)). Из arch-анализа: detour-chain traversal был продублирован 3× (home/stats/builder) + 15 ad-hoc `jsonDecode(configRaw)` сайтов. Создан on-demand query value-object (`outboundByTag`/`detourOf`/`detourChain`/`outboundChain`/`nodeCount`, cycle-safe). Заменены дубли в `home_screen` (count + view-JSON + copy-JSON) и `stats_screen` (detour-map + chain). `ConfigCache` (render hot-path) оставлен отдельно — иная цель. +9 unit tests. Поведение без изменений.

- **§085 R1 — `TagResolver` (единый владелец display-tag logic)** ([roadmap](docs/spec/tasks/085-architecture-roadmap.md), [tag_resolver.dart](app/lib/services/tag_resolver.dart)). Из 28-агентного архитектурного анализа: логика «display-tag ↔ bare-tag» (subscription prefix, detour-маркер `⚙`, collision-suffix) была размазана по 6+ местам, что породило класс багов §077/§079/§080. Вынесена в pure-static `TagResolver` (`displayTag`/`isDetourMarker`/`stripPrefix`/`matchesAllocated`). Рефакторены все call-sites: `server_list_build._withPrefix` (удалён), `subscription_lookup`, home_screen detour-hide + `_findNodeByDisplayTag`, node_filter_screen, detour-picker'ы. Структурно невозможен новый баг этого класса. +30 unit tests. Поведение без изменений.

### Fixed

- **§101 — Стартовая гонка rehydrate↔bootstrap: «серверы в кеше, но не в конфиге» + guard на пустой fetch + атомарный HttpCache** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/101-rehydrate-bootstrap-race.md), [subscription_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/subscription_controller.dart), [http_cache.dart](app/lib/services/subscription/http_cache.dart)). Плавающий field-баг после рестарта app: ноды подписок не персистятся (восстанавливаются из HTTP-кеша асинхронным `_rehydrateFromCache`, fire-and-forget), а bootstrap-rebuild §076 ждал фиксированные **100 мс** — при `configDirty` на холодном старте (true после любого `_persist` без rebuild: fetch-attempt, §098 reorder, §100 sort) `generateConfig()` успевал снять снапшот с `nodes=[]` и **молча** собрать конфиг без нод подписки; mtime свежесобранного конфига делал битый конфиг переживающим рестарты. Фикс: `Completer`-флаг `rehydrationDone` — bootstrap ждёт `Future.wait([rehydrationDone, _controllerInit])` вместо delay; `AutoUpdater.start()` перенесён **после** bootstrap-блока (appStart-fetch'и не бампают mtime настроек посреди bootstrap'а). Заодно закрыты смежные подтверждённые баги:
  - **Empty-fetch guard**: HTTP 200 с нераспознаваемым телом (HTML-заглушка провайдера, challenge) шёл по success-path — затирал рабочий кеш на диске, стирал in-memory ноды, `status=ok`, после чего rehydrate был мёртв навсегда. Теперь 0 распарсенных нод = **failure**: кеш и ноды сохранены, `lastUpdateStatus=failed`, `consecutiveFails+1`. ⚠ Легитимно опустевшая подписка (провайдер удалил все серверы) тоже станет failed — осознанный trade-off: тихо стереть рабочие ноды хуже ложного fail-статуса.
  - **Rehydrate by-ref**: `_rehydrateFromCache` писал `_entries[i]` по индексу через await-границы — `moveEntry`/`removeAt` (§098 reorder) во время старта мог подменить список чужой entry (дубликат, потеря исходного). Теперь итерация по снапшоту ссылок + identity-guard после await'ов (как fetch-путь `_fetchEntryByRef`).
  - **Атомарный `HttpCache.save`**: запись через `<key>.tmp` → rename (body и headers) — kill процесса mid-write больше не оставляет обрезанное тело при `lastNodeCount=N`.
  - Кеш, распарсившийся в 0 нод, теперь логируется (`AppLog.warning` с diagnose-hint), а не молча скипается при stale-счётчике в UI.
  - **Поведенческое**: bootstrap-rebuild на старте теперь ждёт восстановления нод из кеша (обычно сотни мс; корректность > скорость — VPN при автостарте использует сохранённый конфиг, не этот rebuild). +6 интеграционных тестов ([rehydrate_race_test.dart](app/test/subscription/rehydrate_race_test.dart)) + тесты атомарности HttpCache. Device-verify: `Re-hydrated N nodes from cache` в логе идёт раньше `Config built`.

- **§087 — Stale-соединения после смены сети (WiFi↔LTE) — force-reset в корне** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/087-network-change-force-reset.md), [research §086](docs/spec/tasks/086-stale-connections-network-change-doze.md), [DefaultNetworkMonitor.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/DefaultNetworkMonitor.kt), [BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt)). При переключении сети native слал libbox только **passive** `updateDefaultInterface(...)` — ядро узнавало про новый интерфейс (новые коннекты биндились верно), но **существующие** сокеты на мёртвом NIC не закрывались → браузер ретрансмитил в них до TCP-таймаута («старое висит, новое грузится»). `resetNetwork()` (ядро CloseAll + flush DNS + rebind) был реализован, но не вызывался авто. Фикс (§086 variant C): `DefaultNetworkMonitor.checkUpdate` детектит **genuine** смену интерфейса (`prev → new`, оба непустые и разные — НЕ на первый connect / capability-update / disconnect, иначе регрессия класса sing-box #3400 «убить весь TCP на каждый чих») и debounced (1.5s) дёргает `resetNetwork()`. Closes failure mode 1 из §086. (Failure mode 2 — Doze freeze — вне скоупа, research §086 не закончен.)

- **§084 — Code-audit cleanup: High-блок** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/084-code-audit-cleanup.md)). Из 46-агентного аудита кода исправлены все 6 high-находок:
  - **H1 / §081** — `validateConfig` теперь проверяет `outbounds[]/endpoints[].detour` ссылки → `DanglingDetourRef` (fatal). Раньше dangling detour (см. §080) не ловился на Dart-уровне. [validator.dart](app/lib/services/builder/validator.dart), +3 теста.
  - **H2** — удалено мёртвое поле `VlessSpec.encryption` (нигде не читалось/эмитилось).
  - **H3** — hysteria2 `up_mbps`/`down_mbps` теперь round-trip'ятся через URI (`toUriHysteria2` писал в JSON, но не в URI; `parseHysteria2` не читал обратно). +2 теста.
  - **H4** — форматтеры bytes/duration/time вынесены в [format_utils.dart](app/lib/services/format_utils.dart) (были продублированы 3× в stats/live/per_app_trace с расходящимся выводом). +15 тестов.
  - **H5** — `traffic_profiler`: `tcpClose` теперь пишется в global rolling buffer **всегда** (симметрично `tcpOpen`); раньше под `if (_globalRecordingActive)` → при active session без global recording connection lifecycle был неполным.
  - **H6** — `TrafficEvent.copyWith` вместо ручного копирования 20+ полей в hot-path `_pollConnections` (убирает риск дрейфа при добавлении поля).
  - **Medium «консистентность»**: M7 — `isValidNaiveHeaderName`/regex → `uri_utils.dart` (был дубль parser↔emit); M9 — profiler Debug API возвращает единый error-envelope через `Conflict`/`NotFound` (было 4× raw `JsonResponse({'error':...})`); M10 — `auto_updater` docstring (5 триггеров, §027); M14 — уточнён §076-комментарий про native VPN toggles; M16 — удалён мёртвый `_legacyEventSummary`. (M13 оказался false-positive — `persistSources` уже ставит `configDirty`.)

- **§080 — Detour-override picker ломал конфиг при непустом `tag_prefix`** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/080-detour-override-picker-prefix-aware.md), [subscription_detail_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/subscription_detail_screen.dart), [node_settings_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/node_settings_screen.dart)). Audit §077 (finding #13) обнаружил баг того же класса что §077/§079, но ломающий **сборку конфига целиком**. Detour-override picker'ы сохраняли **bare** `node.tag`, а `server_list_build._withPrefix` эмитит целевой outbound с prefixed-тэгом (`'$tagPrefix $base'`). `overrideDetour` подставляется builder'ом прямо в `main.detour` без prefix-трансформации → при непустом `tag_prefix` detour ссылался на несуществующий outbound (sing-box reject `'unknown outbound'` / VPN не стартует). Фикс: оба picker'a строят и сохраняют display-form. Graceful degradation для старых bare-сохранёнок (dropdown показывает None → юзер перевыбирает). Empty-prefix — regression-free. +3 builder теста (display-form valid / bare dangling / empty-prefix).

- **§079 — Detour-серверы с `tag_prefix` не скрывались** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/079-detour-prefix-aware-tag-detection.md), [consts.dart](app/lib/config/consts.dart), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart), [node_filter_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/node_filter_screen.dart)). Тот же класс что §077: `tag.startsWith(kDetourTagPrefix)` (`'⚙ '`) для детекции detour-серверов фейлит на display-form тэгах подписок с непустым `tag_prefix` (`'🇷🇺 RU ⚙ Hop'` → `⚙` в середине строки). Detour-сервера протекали в основной пул нод (home «Hide detour» не скрывал их; node_filter_screen показывал в auto-proxy exclusion list). Фикс: helper `isDetourDisplayTag(tag)` ловит `⚙` и в начале, и в середине (`startsWith || contains(' ⚙ ')`). +unit tests `consts_test.dart`.

- **§078 — Control outbounds always visible + ping в порядке отображения** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/078-control-outbound-and-display-order-ping.md), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart), [home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart)). Два UX-фикса на главной экране:
  - **Control outbounds (direct-out / ✨auto / любой selector / urltest group) теперь всегда matching** независимо от активного filter. До §078 любой включённый chip-filter (subscription / protocol) dim'ил их вместе с не-matching нодами — юзер терял быстрый switch на direct. Фикс: `_isControlTag(tag, state)` короткозамыкает filter pass через `state.proxiesJson.type ∈ {selector, urltest, direct, block, dns}`. NodeFilter pure helper не знает про control — special-case в caller'е.
  - **'Custom' chip** теперь отображается **только** при наличии реальных UserServer'ов. До §078 control outbounds с `subscriptionsOf() == {}` триггерили chip даже без custom servers (см. §077 audit finding #14).
  - **Ping all** теперь iterates `displayList` (sort + manual + pinned + filter) вместо raw `_state.nodes`. UI button передаёт текущий display-order в `runMassUrltest(order: ...)`. При активном filter + `showNonMatching=false` пинг идёт только по видимым нодам в порядке отображения — юзер видит прогресс сверху вниз. Backward-compat: без `order` параметра — старое поведение.

- **§077 — Node filter: subscription chip не мэтчил подписки с `tagPrefix` + ambiguity-aware lookup** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/077-subscription-filter-with-prefix.md), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart), [node_filter.dart](app/lib/screens/home/node_filter.dart), [subscription_lookup.dart](app/lib/screens/home/subscription_lookup.dart) NEW). На главной в `Icons.tune` panel выбор chip'а подписки с непустым `tag_prefix` приводил к тому что **все** её ноды отмечались как non-matching (dim) — фильтр не находил ни одной. Root cause: `_subscriptionsOfTag` сравнивал bare `n.tag` со state.nodes тэгом, который через `server_list_build.dart::_withPrefix` уже несёт prefix (`'$tagPrefix $base'`). 
  - **Primary fix**: сравнение prefixed-form + best-effort handle collision-suffix (`-1`/`-2`/... от `_BuildCtx.allocateTag`). При пустом prefix поведение без изменений (regression-free).
  - **NodeFilter contract rename** (breaking для прямых consumer'ов helper'а): `subscriptionOf: String? Function(String)` → `subscriptionsOf: Set<String> Function(String)`. Predicate теперь intersection-based (`effective.any(subscriptions.contains)`). При коллизии (две подписки с одинаковым prefix+name → builder addочит `-N`) lookup honestly возвращает **все** entries у которых пара мэтчит — нода видна во всех chip'ах подписок которые могли её создать (ambiguity-aware, без deceptive disambiguation).
  - **Pure helper extracted**: `subscriptionsOfTag(tag, entries)` в `home/subscription_lookup.dart` — 18 unit tests покрывают prefix reconstruction, collision-suffix (digit-only), multi-match, UserServer empty, disabled subs skip. Audit blocker «load-bearing logic completely untested» resolved.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **§076 — Settings and config lifecycle (write-on-exit + lazy rebuild + universal NavigatorObserver)** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/076F-settings-and-config-lifecycle/spec.md)). Унификация UI настроек, storage (`lxbox_settings.json`), saved config (`singbox_config.json`) и running tunnel в один прозрачный lifecycle. Два паттерна как design choice:
  - **Lazy (write-on-exit)** для toggle-flood editing screens (`tun_apps_tab`, `routing_screen`, `dns_settings_screen`, `settings_screen` Core VPN tab): mutations только in-memory + sync `_markDirty` (configDirty=true), storage flush на `dispose()` + `AppLifecycleState.paused`, rebuild lazy на возврат к home. **1 settings write + 1 config write per editing session** независимо от количества toggle'ов.
  - **Eager (immediate-write)** для discrete-event screens (`subscriptions_screen`, `app_settings_screen`, `custom_rule_edit_screen`, `node_filter_screen`): immediate save + snackbar feedback. Подходит для add/remove/Save button workflows.
  - **Global `HomeReturnObserver`** ([home_return_observer.dart](app/lib/services/nav/home_return_observer.dart)): универсальный `NavigatorObserver` зарегистрирован в `MaterialApp.navigatorObservers`. Срабатывает на любой `didPop` когда home (root route) становится top. Покрывает все навигационные пути (drawer, long-press, system back, swipe, programmatic pop, cross-navigation между settings screens). Раньше rebuild trigger был в `_pushRoute.then()` callback — терялся при опен через long-press на Nodes header.
  - **`HomeController.markConfigChangedNeedRestart()`** — external mark для настроек применяемых вне config pipeline (native VPN System toggles: `allow_bypass` / `keep_on_exit` / `background_mode`). Gated на `tunnelUp` (если tunnel down — значение применится на следующем start без restart prompt). Home banner показывает «Restart VPN» — единый source-of-truth, локальные snackbar'ы про restart удалены.
  - **mtime-based bootstrap** ([config_dirty_check.dart](app/lib/services/config_dirty_check.dart)): на launch `subController.init` сравнивает `lxbox_settings.json.mtime > singbox_config.json.mtime` → восстанавливает `configDirty` после kill mid-edit. `home_screen._initSubsAndAutoUpdate` триггерит тихий bootstrap rebuild → юзер не видит banner на старте, всё применилось.
  - **Banner gate переписан**: синий «Settings changed» показывается при `configDirty=true` **всегда** (без `tunnelUp` gate). Розовый «Restart VPN» показывается при `tunnelUp && configChangedNeedRestart && !configDirty` — mutually exclusive с синим (два banner'а одновременно не появляются).
  - **Rename**: `HomeState.configStaleSinceStart` → `configChangedNeedRestart` (in 5 files). Debug API `/state` JSON key `config_stale_since_start` → `config_changed_need_restart` — **breaking** для external consumers. Добавлен computed `config_dirty: bool` для диагностики.
  - **Race fixes**: `_markDirty` синхронно set'ит `configDirty=true` (race-safe для observer handler'а который читает сразу после dispose). `_persist` НЕ set'ит `configDirty` после await'ов (исправлен blink pink→blue после rebuild).

- **§074 — Add server wizard (SOCKS5 form + Paste URI + Paste JSON)** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/074F-add-server-wizard/spec.md), [add_server_wizard_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/add_server_wizard_screen.dart), [subscription_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/subscription_controller.dart), [subscriptions_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/subscriptions_screen.dart)). Long-press на «+» в Subscriptions screen → full-screen route с 3 tabs:
  - **SOCKS5** — структурированная форма: tag (default `local-socks5-out`), host (`127.0.0.1`), port (`1080`), username/password (optional), display name (optional → `UserServer.name`, отображается как entry title в Subscriptions list). Form validation (port 1..65535, host non-empty). Default values заточены под locally hosted SOCKS5 / DPI bypass tooling. Submit → constructs `SocksSpec(label = tag)` directly, persisted **как sing-box outbound JSON** в `rawBody` (не URI — URI fragment round-trip ломает tag т.к. `parseSocks` derive'ит tag из label-fragment'а), wraps в `UserServer(origin: manual)`, добавляется через новый `subController.addUserServer(...)` helper. Regression test: `socks_wizard_roundtrip_test.dart`.
  - **Paste URI** — multiline text area для `vless://…` / `vmess://…` / `trojan://…` / `socks5://…` / `wireguard://…` etc. Routes через существующий `addFromInput` (тот же путь что у tap-«+»).
  - **Paste JSON** — multiline outbound JSON ({type:vless,…}). Single object или array. WireGuard auto-routes в `endpoints[]` через builder pipeline.
  - Cancel + Add buttons в AppBar (Material standard для full-screen modals).
  - Tab switch сохраняет поля. Snackbar после add показывает tag который юзер ввёл (builder'овская суффиксация при collision видна в node list).
  - Tap на «+» = existing paste-clipboard / parse-text-input flow без изменений. Wizard также доступен через «Add server…» в overflow menu (три точки в AppBar) — explicit affordance для discoverability.

### Changed

- **§073 — Detour: `Override` → `Add detour` с режимом append (default) и checkbox replace** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/073-detour-append-vs-replace.md), [server_list.dart](app/lib/models/server_list.dart), [server_list_build.dart](app/lib/services/builder/server_list_build.dart), [subscription_detail_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/subscription_detail_screen.dart)). До §073 mode `Override` в Subscription detail полностью **заменял** нативную detour-цепочку из конфига одним выбранным outbound'ом. Юзер запросил режим **append**: ноды идут по своей родной цепочке, а в конец добавляется выбранный hop (jumphost ladder с дописываемым последним exit).
  - **Renamed**: radio item `Override` → `Add detour`. Subtitle разводит «Append → X» (default) и «Replace chain → X» (toggle ON).
  - **Added**: `SwitchListTile` «Replace existing chain» под outbound picker. OFF (default) = append; ON = старое replace.
  - **Builder**: `ServerListBuild.build` — новая ветка для append: `skipDetour=false`, `main.detour = detours.first.tag`, `detours.last.map['detour'] = overrideDetour` (override спайс'ится хвостом). Пустая native chain → 1-hop как раньше.
  - **Storage**: `DetourPolicy.replaceDetourChain: bool` (default false). JSON key `replace_detour_chain`. Старые backup'ы без ключа → default append. ⚠ **Поведение для existing юзеров с override меняется** — была implicit replace, стала append. Toggle ON чтобы вернуть старое поведение.

### Fixed

- **§075 — Tunnel apps: regenerate config + единый restart flow** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/075-tun-apps-restart-regen-config.md), [tun_apps_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/tun_apps_tab.dart)). Incident 2026-06-06: юзер выбрал Mode=Deny-list + добавил Internet (`com.heytap.browser`), tap Restart → Internet всё равно ходил через VPN. Verified via Debug API: storage `{mode:deny, packages:[com.heytap.browser]}` ✅, applied config inbound[tun] — НЕТ `exclude_package` ❌. Root cause: `_persist` обновлял только storage, `_restartVpn` делал `stop()→start()` без regenerate, native читал **last saved config** который не пересобран. Фикс приводит tun_apps_tab к pattern'у `routing_screen._apply`: `_persist` теперь делает `setTunApps → generateConfig → saveParsedConfig`. Локальный «Restart needed» banner + локальный «Restart now» button + `_appliedCfg` snapshot удалены — единый source-of-truth через `configStaleSinceStart` flag и глобальный home banner. То же поведение что у routing changes.

- **§072 — `SettingsStorage` атомарная запись + восстановление из `.bak`** ([task spec](docs/spec/tasks/072-settings-storage-atomic-write.md), [settings_storage.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage.dart), [settings_storage_test.dart](app/test/services/settings_storage_test.dart)). Раз в пару дней на Xiaomi/HyperOS (воспроизведено на Pad 8 Pro) у юзера **полностью** сбрасывались все настройки — vars, подписки, server lists, custom rules, DNS. Root cause: `_save()` использовал `File.writeAsString` без `flush` (truncate-then-write); kill между truncate и записью → пустой/обрезанный JSON; `_load()` ловил `FormatException` в немом `catch (_) {}` и проваливался в `_cache = {}`; первый же `setVar` после этого фиксировал потерю. Фикс:
  - **Атомарная запись**: `_save()` теперь делает (1) `copy(main → .bak)` если main валиден, (2) `write(.tmp, flush: true)`, (3) `tmp.rename(main)` — POSIX `rename(2)` атомарен в пределах одной FS. Kill между copy и tmp-write оставляет main + старый .bak. Kill между tmp-write и rename — то же.
  - **Decision tree в `_load()`**: main отсутствует → `{}` (fresh install); main парсится → return; main битый + `.bak` валиден → recovery (`AppLog.warning`); main битый + bak нет → return `{}` + sticky-флаг `_mainIsCorrupted` + `AppLog.error` (раз за сессию). Critical: при corruption main файл **не перезаписывается** автоматически — оставляется для ручной диагностики. Sticky-флаг сбрасывается на первой успешной atomic-записи (юзер начал заново вводить данные).
  - **Cleanup**: stale `.tmp` от прошлого crashed save удаляется в начале `_load()`.
  - +12 unit tests (`settings_storage_test.dart`): round-trip, recovery из .bak, drop без bak, empty file truncate, .tmp cleanup, migrate proxy_sources, .bak только из валидного main, fresh после drop.

### Added

- **§070 — Sort options long-press menu** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/070F-sort-options/spec.md), [home_state.dart](app/lib/models/home_state.dart), [home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). На главной у sort-кнопки в node header добавлен long-press → popup `CheckedPopupMenuItem`×3:
  - **Pin DIRECT to top** (default ON) — `direct-out` в pinned section.
  - **Pin AUTO to top** (default ON) — `✨auto` в pinned section.
  - **Re-sort on manual ping** (default ON) — пересчитывать порядок при `runNodeUrltest(tag)` (single ping). OFF → manual ping обновляет число, но **ряд не прыгает**; UI-cache (`_viewSortedNodes`) держит frozen sort до `state.pingBatchGen` bump.
  - `pingBatchGen` — passive counter, bump'ается в `runMassUrltest` финале, `runGroupUrltest`, `setSelectedGroup`, `saveParsedConfig` — четыре «легитимных re-sort» точки. Single manual ping → cache hit → frozen order.
  - **Yellow dot indicator** на sort-кнопке когда хоть одна опция non-default.
  - Toggles per-session in-memory (consistency с §048 filter state), не persist'ятся.
  - Default behaviour bit-exact: все 3 toggle = ON → старый sort.

- **§071 — Manual node reorder via drag** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/071F-manual-node-reorder/spec.md), [home_state.dart](app/lib/models/home_state.dart), [home_controller.dart](app/lib/controllers/home_controller.dart), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). Четвёртый sort mode `NodeSortMode.manual` (icon `⠿ Icons.drag_indicator`), активируется **только** через drag — в `cycleSortMode` не входит (`NodeSortMode.next` обходит manual: default → ping → A-Z → default).
  - **8% от ширины row, transparent strip** на левом крае каждого non-pinned ряда (Stack + Positioned overlay) с `ReorderableDragStartListener` — long-press + drag начинает reorder. Текст и иконки внутри `NodeRow` не сдвигаются.
  - Drag → `commitManualReorder` переключает sortMode в `manual` + сохраняет порядок в `state.manualOrder`. Per-session in-memory.
  - **Exit:** короткий tap по sort-кнопке (cycle) выходит из `manual` → `defaultOrder`, `manualOrder` **сбрасывается**. Юзер опять начал drag → manual mode re-enter с fresh порядком.
  - **Pinned (direct/auto)** — non-draggable; drop в pinned зону clamped под pinned (`onReorder` guard).
  - **Новые ноды** (subscription update / add server) → в конец manual order. Удалённые → автоматически отфильтрованы.
  - +18 unit tests (`home_state_sort_test.dart`): `next` cycle exit, pin toggles в `latencyAsc`/`nameAsc`, manual order applied, новые в конец, удалённые отфильтрованы, pinDirect ON/OFF под manual, copyWith new fields.

- **§048 — Home node filters: regex + emoji + protocol + subscription + test (ping)** ([feature spec](docs/spec/tasks/048F-home-node-filters/spec.md), [node_filter.dart](app/lib/screens/home/node_filter.dart), [filter_widgets.dart](app/lib/screens/home/filter_widgets.dart), [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). На главной у списка нод есть icon-кнопка `Icons.tune` справа в header (раньше открывала popup с одним пунктом «Show detour servers» — теперь expand toggle для filter panel). Panel содержит:
  - **Regex** text field с двумя toggle: левый checkbox — on/off filter без потери pattern (auto-on при вводе валидного pattern); `[!]` внутри suffix перед `✕` — invert/NOT (`!regex.hasMatch(tag)`, OR-семантика alternations сохраняется — `!(a|b)`). Debounce 300ms; invalid pattern → red `Invalid regex` hint.
  - **Emoji chips** в горизонтальной полоске — extracted из всех node tags (включая detour), отсортированы по частоте + alphabetical tiebreak. Tap chip → emoji appended в regex field как OR-pattern (`🇷🇺` потом `🇺🇸` → `🇷🇺|🇺🇸`).
  - **Protocol chips** (multi-select FilterChip, horizontal scroll row) — unique protocols из current pool (vless / vmess / trojan / shadowsocks / hysteria2 / ...). Empty selection = all allowed.
  - **Subscription chips** (multi-select, horizontal scroll) — display names enabled подписок с непустым `nodes` (`SubscriptionServers.nodes.isNotEmpty`) + special «Custom» если есть `UserServer`'ы.
  - **Test ≤ N ms** numeric input с собственным checkbox — debounced 300ms; untested nodes (`delay==null`) всегда matching (locked decision #11). Checkbox позволяет временно выключить filter не теряя значение.
  - **Show detour servers** checkbox — existing toggle переехал из popup в panel.
  - **Show non-matching (dimmed)** checkbox (default ON) — non-matching ноды рендерятся внизу с opacity 0.4 вместо скрытия. Юзер видит весь pool, понимает что подходит под фильтр. OFF → классический filter behaviour.
  - **Двухфазная модель**: detour show/hide — pool filter (caller), regex / protocol / subscription / test — match filter (`NodeFilter.passes`). NodeFilter не знает про detour — clean separation.
  - All filters AND-комбинируются. Per-session in-memory state (как `_showDetourNodes`).
  - Visual hint: `Icons.tune` color = primary когда есть active match-filter, даже когда panel collapsed.
  - +27 unit tests на `NodeFilter` (extractEmojis с RIS flags, regex case-insensitive, regex invert ON/OFF, protocol exclusive, untested ping pass, AND combine, detour не в predicate).

- **§068 — `NodeViewItem` view-model class extracted** ([spec](docs/spec/tasks/068-node-view-item-extract.md), [node_view_item.dart](app/lib/widgets/node_view_item.dart), [node_row.dart](app/lib/widgets/node_row.dart)). `NodeRow` widget раньше принимал 14+ explicit args через конструктор — partial view-model в форме arguments-bag. Extract сделан **внутри** PR §048 (closes §068) потому что добавление `matches: bool` для filter feature раздуло itemBuilder и стало естественно отделить «собрали snapshot строки» от «нарисовали». `NodeRow(item: NodeViewItem, ...callbacks)` — single source data shape. `Opacity(opacity: item.matches ? 1.0 : 0.4)` wrapper внутри `NodeRow.build` — single source of opacity, magic 0.4 не утекает в caller.

- **OEM battery restrictions follow-up dialog** ([home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). После того как юзер тапнул «Allow» в нашем rationale и затем «Разрешить» в системном `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` dialog'е → app в AOSP whitelist, но **OEM (ColorOS/MIUI/MagicOS на OnePlus/OPPO/Realme/Xiaomi/Honor) имеют proprietary battery toggles поверх AOSP**, которые наш intent НЕ контролирует. Показывается follow-up dialog «Disable battery restrictions» с инструкцией («Battery usage → Don't optimize» + «On OnePlus/OPPO/Realme: Stop activity when idle → OFF») и deep-link на App Info через `ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS`. Cooldown 24h на rationale убран — спрашиваем при каждом запуске пока permission не дан.
- **«Restore from backup» link в empty state главного экрана** ([home_screen.dart::_buildAddServerCta](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart)). Если у юзера нет server_lists/custom_rules (после fresh install) — под FAB «Add a server» появляется ненавязчивая кнопка «🔄 Restore from backup». Тап → SAF native file picker (`Intent.ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` через `file_picker` plugin) — юзер выбирает `lxbox-backup-*.json`. После `applyImport` сразу триггерится `_subController.init()` + `AutoUpdater.maybeUpdateAll(manual, force: true)` — подписки fetch'аются в фоне без необходимости restart app'а. Snackbar «Imported: ... · fetching subscriptions…».

### Removed

- **Legacy `SelectableRule` режим без `preset_id`** ([§067 spec](docs/spec/tasks/067-selectable-rule-legacy-cleanup.md)). До §033 (v1.4.x) `SelectableRule` мог быть в шаблоне без `preset_id` — конвертировался в `CustomRule(kind: inline/srs)` копированием полей. С §033 (v1.5+) все рулы в `wizard_template.json` имеют `preset_id`, конвертер `selectableRuleToCustom` для empty presetId возвращал null silently — dead code.
  - `SelectableRule.presetId` теперь `required` (default `''` удалён).
  - `SelectableRule.fromJson` бросает `FormatException` если в шаблоне отсутствует `preset_id`.
  - `selectableRuleToCustom` возвращает `CustomRulePreset` (non-nullable, был `?`).
  - Убраны 2 null-check'а в `routing_screen.dart` (`_migrateLegacyRules` + `_copyPreset`).
  - Docstring `parser_config.dart::SelectableRule` упрощён — упоминания «Legacy (1.4.x)» режима убраны.
  - Test «без preset_id → null» переписан в «`fromJson` без preset_id → FormatException».

## [1.8.3] — 2026-05-12

«Pre-commit hook auto-sync» release. Завершает рефакторинг версионирования начатый в v1.8.2: теперь pubspec обновляется автоматом при каждом `git commit`, никаких manual шагов.

### Changed

- **Pre-commit hook автоматически синхронизирует `app/pubspec.yaml` с git state** ([§066 spec](docs/spec/tasks/066-pubspec-sync-hook.md), [.githooks/pre-commit](.githooks/pre-commit), [scripts/sync-pubspec-version.sh](scripts/sync-pubspec-version.sh)).
  - `versionName` = `${last_tag#v}` (clean release) или `${last_tag#v}-dev.${commits_since}` (между тегами).
  - `versionCode` = `git rev-list --count HEAD + 1` (monotonic).
  - Setup: один раз после clone `./scripts/setup-hooks.sh` → `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
  - На tag push CI override'ит pubspec из tag'а (hook не triggers на `git tag`) — production APK получает чистую `X.Y.Z`.
- **UpdateChecker skip для `-dev` версий** ([update_checker.dart](app/lib/services/update_checker.dart)). `_isDevBuild(version)` → если version содержит `-dev` или начинается с `0.0.0` → `hydrate()` и `maybeCheck()` exit early. Никаких snackbar'ов «X.Y.Z available» в dev сессиях. `forceCheck()` (manual «Check now») не skip — юзер явно нажал.
- **`scripts/build-local-apk.sh` упрощён** — убраны `--dart-define BUILD_LOCAL / BUILD_GIT_DESC / BUILD_LAST_TAG / BUILD_COMMITS_SINCE_TAG / BUILD_TIME`. Pubspec.yaml — единственный источник, читается через `PackageInfo.fromPlatform()`.
- **`about_screen.dart` упрощён** — удалены 5 `String.fromEnvironment('BUILD_*')` const'ов и `_LocalBuildBadge` widget. Остаётся только `v${VersionInfo.I.version}` (уже включает `-dev.N` если dev build).

### Removed

- `--dart-define BUILD_*` pass-through между local build script ↔ Dart code.
- `_LocalBuildBadge` widget в About screen.
- pubspec.yaml comment block про «placeholder» — теперь pubspec не placeholder, hook поддерживает живую версию.

---

## [1.8.2] — 2026-05-12

«Version from tag — single source of truth» release. Финальный fix дублирования версии (v1.8.0 hotfix → v1.8.1 guard → v1.8.2 elimination). Tag теперь единственный источник правды, никаких bump-коммитов в репо при release-flow.

### Changed

- **Версия — derived from git tag, не hardcoded в коде** ([§065 spec](docs/spec/tasks/065-version-from-tag.md), [version_info.dart](app/lib/services/version_info.dart), [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml), [scripts/build-local-apk.sh](scripts/build-local-apk.sh)).
  - `app/pubspec.yaml` навсегда удерживается на placeholder `version: 0.0.0-dev+0`. CI и local build script переписывают line перед `flutter build`, не commit'ят в репо.
  - `versionName` = `${tag#v}` (например `v1.8.2 → 1.8.2`).
  - `versionCode` = `git rev-list --count HEAD` (monotonic).
  - About screen + UpdateChecker используют `VersionInfo.I.version` (load из `PackageInfo.fromPlatform()` в `main()` перед `runApp`). Sync-доступ, single source.
  - **Удалена** `static const _version` в `about_screen.dart` + `AboutScreen.versionString` alias. Удалён CI «Version consistency check» step (нечего сверять — один источник).
  - **Release commit message теперь `docs(release): vX.Y.Z notes`**, без `bump to X.Y.Z+N`. Bump-коммиты больше не нужны.
  - [`docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md) §2.2 переписан под новый flow.

### Fixed

- **Local dev: `flutter run` показывал старую версию** — теперь `0.0.0-dev` (placeholder) или `X.Y.Z-dev.N` если запущен через `scripts/build-local-apk.sh` (derive'ит из `git describe`).

---

## [1.8.1] — 2026-05-12

Hotfix для v1.8.0: hardcoded UI-версия не была поднята при release-bump'е.

### Fixed

- **About screen и UpdateChecker показывали `v1.7.0` на v1.8.0 build** ([about_screen.dart:13](app/lib/screens/about_screen.dart:13)). При bump'е v1.8.0 поднял `pubspec.yaml` version и весь release-docs набор, но забыл `static const _version = '1.7.0'` в About screen — она читается `UpdateChecker.checkForUpdate()` через `AboutScreen.versionString` и показывается в Settings → About. Эффект: app собран как 1.8.0 (Android `versionName=1.8.0`), но в UI «v1.7.0» + snackbar «v1.8.0 available» сразу после установки.
- Backup-файлы записывают `source_app_version` через `PackageInfo.fromPlatform()` (= pubspec) — там было корректно 1.8.0; UI был единственным affected surface.

### Added

- **CI version consistency check** ([.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) → `checks` job, новый step «Version consistency check»). Сверяет `pubspec.yaml` `version:`, `about_screen.dart` `_version`, и git tag (на release run). Mismatch → CI fail до сборки APK, release-tag не уйдёт с расхождением.
- **Release process docs обновлены** ([docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md) §2.2). Теперь явно перечислены **два** места куда записывается версия + why необходимы оба, со ссылкой на CI guard.

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-11

«Backup overhaul + routing order fix» release. Главное — **§063/§040 backup format переписан** под полный snapshot (старый формат терял `custom_rules`, `tun_apps`, `enabled_groups` и т.д.); **§062 — fix custom_rules cross-kind order** (storage order теперь end-to-end управляемый между preset/inline/srs); **§053 — `custom_rule_edit_screen.dart` split** Stage 1+2+3 (2060 → 456 LOC, −77%); plus tooltip on Allow VPN bypass и View tab preview fix для disabled-правил.

**Breaking:** backup-файлы старого формата (`{vars, server_lists}` на корне, `version: 1`) reject'ятся при import. Пере-export после обновления.

### Fixed

- **Custom rule editor — View tab показывал пустой preview для disabled правил** ([view_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/custom_rule_edit/tabs/view_tab.dart), [post_steps.dart](app/lib/services/builder/post_steps.dart)). Юзер открывал editor disabled-правила, переходил на View → видел `{rule_set: [], rules: []}` потому что `applyCustomRules` фильтровал по `cr.enabled`. Семантика «что родит в реальном конфиге» уместна для production pipeline, **но не для editor preview** — юзер открыл editor именно для inspect'а формы. Фикс: добавлен parameter `skipDisabled` на `applyCustomRules` (default `true` для backward-compat; production pipeline `applyAllCustomRules` поведение не меняется). `ViewTab` зовёт с `skipDisabled: false` — preview показывает «что родит при включении» независимо от Switch.

- **§062 — custom_rules order был broken между kind-ами (preset/inline/srs)** ([§062 spec](docs/spec/tasks/062-custom-rules-unified-order.md)). `SettingsStorage.custom_rules` это **один список** с mixed `kind`, и UI/Debug API (`POST /rules/reorder`) предполагали что storage order = order matching в sing-box `route.rules[]`. Builder ломал это: вызывал `applyPresetBundles` (только preset) → `applyCustomRules` (только inline/srs) последовательно, поэтому в финальном config все preset правила оказывались **перед** всеми inline/srs независимо от storage order. Юзер ставил `RU apps inline` между `Private IPs preset` и `Russian domains preset`, но в sing-box config inline всегда уезжал в самый конец. Reorder API «провёртывался вхолостую».
  - **Фикс** — новый `applyAllCustomRules` обходит rules в одном цикле с dispatch по kind. Per-rule logic вынесена в private `_applyPresetSingle` / `_applyInlineSingle` / `_applySrsSingle`. Старые public `applyPresetBundles` / `applyCustomRules` остались как **shim** через те же private — backward-compat для тестов.
  - **Cross-preset rule_set dedup** переехал с `mergeFragments` на `RuleSetRegistry.tryRegisterRuleSet` (identical-skip / first-wins warning) — работает естественно при per-rule обходе.
  - **Verified on device**: storage `[Block Ads, Private IPs, RU apps inline, Russian domains preset, ...]` теперь даёт config `[ads-all, ip_is_private, RU apps, ru-domains, ...]` — порядок 1-к-1 (за вычетом 3 system rules `resolve`/`sniff`/`dns hijack` в голове).
  - Tests: 614 → 620, +6 в `test/services/builder/apply_all_custom_rules_test.dart` покрывают cross-kind order, mixed kinds, identical-skip + cross-kind, DNS aspect.

### Added

- **Info tooltip на `Allow VPN bypass` toggle** ([settings_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart)). Tap-trigger `Tooltip` с `info_outline` icon рядом с заголовком — объясняет: что делает (`ConnectivityManager.bindProcessToNetwork()` bypass), когда полезно (банкинг, captive portal, системные сервисы), что значит off (strict tunnel), что применяется на next VPN connect. Тот же паттерн что в DNS settings (`triggerMode: tap`, 12-сек показ).

### Refactor

- **§053 Stage 2 + Stage 3 — sections + tabs + state controller выделены из `custom_rule_edit_screen.dart`** ([§053 spec](docs/spec/tasks/053-custom-rule-editor-split.md)).
  - **Stage 2 (v14090)** — 7 секций + 2 shared widgets вынесены в `screens/custom_rule_edit/sections/` и `widgets/`. Sections — dumb `StatelessWidget` с props (controllers + callbacks); `ItemsField` — единственный `StatefulWidget` (подписан на controller через `addListener` для self-rebuild). Editor: 1795 → 1330 LOC.
  - **Stage 3 (v14100)** — выделен **`CustomRuleEditController extends ChangeNotifier`** ([edit_controller.dart](app/lib/screens/custom_rule_edit/edit_controller.dart)): владеет всеми 8 `TextEditingController`-ами, флагами (`enabled`, `kind`, `outbound`, `ipIsPrivate`), коллекциями (`protocols`, `packages`, `wifiNetworks`, `varsValues`), async state (`srsState`, `boolVarDownloading`, `presetSrsPaths`) + mutator'ами + `snapshot()` / `isDirty()` + pure async (`downloadSrs` / `clearSrsCache` / `onBoolVarToggle`). Раздаётся вниз через `CustomRuleEditScope` (plain `InheritedNotifier` — без новых deps). Tabs — отдельные widgets: `tabs/params_tab.dart` (inline/srs ветка), `tabs/preset_params_tab.dart` (preset §033 + bool-toggle §045 download), `tabs/view_tab.dart` (storage shape + sing-box preview, наследует `presetSrsPaths` из controller). Editor scaffold: 1330 → 456 LOC (−65%; от исходных 2060 — −77%). Save-icon выделен в `_SaveIconButton` через `AnimatedBuilder` чтобы dirty-rebuild не дёргал весь AppBar.
  - `widgets/wifi_entry.dart`, `widgets/wifi_saved_picker_sheet.dart`, `widgets/wifi_manual_add_dialog.dart` — extracted в Stage 1 (v14080); `screens/custom_rule_edit/wifi_zip.dart` — Stage 3 (top-level zip/unzip helpers вместо file-private). На screen State остались только UI-actions требующие BuildContext: save/back/delete dialog'и, cloud-menu, picker-вызовы, snackbar'ы. Save flow unchanged — `snapshot().withName(finalName)` тот же. **Тесты: 620 pass; analyzer clean.**

### Changed

- **Backup format переписан под полный snapshot — single-format, no legacy support** ([§040 spec](docs/spec/tasks/040F-backup-restore-ui/spec.md), [backup_service.dart](app/lib/services/backup_service.dart), [debug/handlers/backup.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/backup.dart), [settings_storage.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage.dart)). Старый формат `{vars, server_lists}` на корне **не сохранял большую часть пользовательских данных** — `custom_rules`, `tun_apps`, `enabled_groups`, `enabled_rules`, `route_final`, `rule_outbounds`, `dns_options` живут как top-level ключи `lxbox_settings.json`, а export'ил только `data['vars']`. Inline rule_set'ы вида «Ru Apps» (57 пакетов через `CustomRule.inline`) **исчезали при restore**.
  - Новый wire-format: `{app, kind, created_at, source_app_version, storage: <lxbox_settings.json целиком>, vpn_settings: {auto_start, keep_on_exit, background_mode, core_logs_enabled, allow_bypass}}`. `version` поле убрано — single-format, файлы старого образца reject'ятся с message «Unsupported backup format. Re-export from a recent app version.»
  - **`storage` блок** = deep-clone всего `lxbox_settings.json` через новый `SettingsStorage.exportRaw()`. Restore — через `SettingsStorage.replaceRaw(map, merge: bool)`: при `merge=false` overwrite целиком, при `merge=true` top-level merge с recursive vars upsert.
  - **`vpn_settings` блок** — отдельный native-side state из `boxvpn_boot` SharedPreferences (BootReceiver читает at boot-time когда Flutter ещё не запущен; не перенесён в `lxbox_settings.json` ради simplicity). 5 toggles read через `BoxVpnClient` getters / write через сеттеры.
  - **Категории UI — 5** (было 4): Server lists, Routing, App settings, **VPN system toggles** (новая), Debug API. Filter работает на уровне keys в `storage` map (а не split на vars-сегменты). Добавление новой top-level настройки в storage → автоматически в backup, без правок allowlist'ов.
  - Debug API `/backup/export|import` синхронизирован с UI — symmetric round-trip.
  - **Тест round-trip** ([backup_service_test.dart](app/test/services/backup_service_test.dart), 13 cases): export (все категории) → wipe → import → diff(restored, original) == 0; selective categories, merge vs replace, legacy reject.

### Docs

- **§054 — spec reorg: features vs tasks classification audit** ([§054 spec](docs/spec/tasks/054-spec-reorg-features-vs-tasks.md)). `docs/spec/features/` теперь содержит **только живые** продуктовые / архитектурные концепции. Семь демотированных в `docs/spec/tasks/`: ~~001~~ mobile stack → [`055`](docs/spec/tasks/055-mobile-stack-decision/spec.md) (historical architectural decision), ~~002~~ MVP scope → [`056`](docs/spec/tasks/056-mvp-scope-historical/spec.md) (historical milestone), ~~004x~~ subscription parser → [`057`](docs/spec/tasks/057-subscription-parser-v1-superseded/spec.md) (superseded by §026), ~~005x~~ config generator → [`058`](docs/spec/tasks/058-config-generator-wizard-v1-superseded/spec.md) (superseded by §026), ~~013~~ routing → [`059`](docs/spec/tasks/059-routing-v1-superseded/spec.md) (superseded by §030), ~~039~~ libbox 1.13 migration → [`060`](docs/spec/tasks/060-libbox-1-13-migration/spec.md) (one-shot, Done), ~~041~~ DNS rules refactor → [`061`](docs/spec/tasks/061-dns-rules-refactor/spec.md) (live spec — §014). Освобождённые номера (001/002/004/005/013/039/041) **не переиспользуются**. Все cross-refs обновлены в `docs/**/*.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `app/lib/**/*.dart`, `app/test/**/*.dart`; grep на retired numbers — 0 hits; `flutter analyze` — 0 errors.

- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Feature Specs map синхронизирован с реоргом** + **`CHANGELOG.md` chronological order** ([commit `24558a5`](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/commit/24558a5)). В ARCHITECTURE убраны 7 демотированных из live-таблицы, добавлена явная "Демотированные через §054" секция с маппингом старый→новый. В CHANGELOG: блок `[1.2.0]` ошибочно стоял между `[1.4.0]` и `[1.3.1]` — переставлен в правильный newest-first порядок.

- **§047 — Public Intent API spec расширен** ([§047 spec](docs/spec/tasks/047F-public-intent-api/spec.md)). Outgoing events (broadcast intents от LxBox в эфир: `VPN_STATE_CHANGED`, `CONFIG_RELOAD`, `RULE_FIRED` опционально) + 2 incoming actions (`SET_RULE_ENABLED`, `SWITCH_PRESET_GROUP`) + symmetric input/output pattern. Status остаётся **Draft** — не имплементировано.

## [1.7.3] — 2026-05-10

«UX rework + perf» release. Главное — **§052 VPN Settings reorganisation** (System/Core tabs), **§051 Phase 2-3 wifi rules editor + auto-record history**, **F22 part 2 logging pipeline production-grade**, **CoreLogsHintBanner** общий widget с deep-link на Diagnostics, и Live tab tap-to-filter через row identifiers.

### Changed

- **§052 — VPN Settings reorganisation: System / Core tabs + reshuffle** ([§052 spec](docs/spec/tasks/052-vpn-settings-system-service-tabs.md)). Drawer → VPN Settings теперь 2 tab'а с чёткой семантикой:
  - **System** — Android-side VPN controls через `VpnService.Builder` API. Сейчас: `Allow VPN bypass` (§049 F15), `Keep VPN on exit`, `Tunnel sleep mode` (`BackgroundMode.never|lazy|always`).
  - **Core** — sing-box engine vars (`chapter: 'core'` в template — `mtu` / `log_level` / `dns_final` / …). Routing- и DNS-специфичные vars (chapter: routing/dns) живут на своих экранах.
  - **App Settings → Background tab удалён** (TabBar 3→2: General + Diagnostics). `Keep on exit` + `Tunnel sleep mode` переехали в VPN Settings → System; permissions block (Battery / Notifications / Location / NearbyWifi / App info) — в App Settings → Diagnostics в interactive виде (как был в Background, целиком копируется блок).
  - **Tunnel apps mode + packages — остаётся в Routing → Tunnel apps** (4-я вкладка). Не переезжает: юзеру привычно искать «куда роутится app» в Routing.
  - Bonus fix: `DebugScreen → ⋮ → Diagnostics settings` использовал `AppSettingsScreen(initialTab: 2)`. После удаления Background tab indices сместились (Diagnostics: 2→1), `clamp(0, 1)` молча клипало 2 → 1, но семантика была сломана. Поправлен `2 → 1`.
- **Deep-links between dependent tabs and settings**. Tab'ы которые depend на глобальном toggle (core_logs_enabled / VPN settings) теперь умеют open соответствующий screen с правильно открытым tab'ом. Общий `initialTab: int` parameter pattern на `AppSettingsScreen` / `SettingsScreen` (`DefaultTabController.initialIndex` + clamp). Реализация:
  - **Statistics → Live + Per-app → contextual `CoreLogsHintBanner`** ([core_logs_hint_banner.dart](app/lib/widgets/core_logs_hint_banner.dart), [live_events_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/live_events_tab.dart), [per_app_trace_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/per_app_trace_tab.dart)). Inline banner widget показывается **только когда `core_logs_enabled=false`**; self-hides при включении (auto-refresh на `AppLifecycleState.resumed`). Split hit-zone: левая (i + «DNS / router events off») → tooltip с объяснением что без core logs DNS resolves пропадают и process attribution ухудшается; правая («turn on Forward sing-box logs» + chevron) → deep-link в App Settings → Diagnostics с auto-scroll и подсветкой нужного toggle'а. Это лучше чем PopupMenu (⋮) overflow item: явно виден когда нужен и pulls user's attention.
  - **Routing → Tunnel apps → ⋮ → "VPN settings (Core)"** ([tun_apps_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/tun_apps_tab.dart)) → `SettingsScreen(initialTab: 1)`. Юзер настраивает Tunnel apps mode и хочет рядом mtu / log_level / dns_final — overflow deep-link уместен (state-independent, не «toggle off-warning»).
  - **Drawer → Debug → ⋮ → "Diagnostics settings"** ([debug_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/debug_screen.dart)) → `AppSettingsScreen(initialTab: 1)` — fast-path на «Forward sing-box logs» toggle + Quit&reopen.

### Added

- **Debug API — `/settings/vpn/*` endpoints** для §052 System toggles ([settings.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/settings.dart), [debug-api-reference.md](docs/api/debug-api-reference.md)). Закрывают gap «UI есть, API нет». Все три — GET / PUT, `body {"enabled": bool}` или `{"mode": "never|lazy|always"}`:
  - `GET|PUT /settings/vpn/allow_bypass` — `VpnService.Builder.allowBypass()`. Apply at next `establish()` (start или reload VPN).
  - `GET|PUT /settings/vpn/keep_on_exit` — keep VPN running когда app закрывается. Live-effect не нужен.
  - `GET|PUT /settings/vpn/background_mode` — foreground-service tunnel sleep mode. Apply at next VPN connect.
  - `GET /state/vpn` расширен — теперь включает `allow_bypass` + `background_mode` (одним запросом snapshot всех VPN-system флагов).
- **§051 Phase 2 — Wi-Fi rule editor UI** ([§051 spec](docs/spec/tasks/051-custom-rule-wifi-conditions.md), [custom_rule_edit_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/custom_rule_edit_screen.dart)). Editor `CustomRule` теперь содержит секцию **WI-FI NETWORK** между Protocol и Save:
  - Chip list `_wifiNetworks: List<_WifiEntry>` — каждая chip = одна сеть `(ssid, bssid?)`. Дедуп при add (composite key).
  - **Add current** — читает текущий SSID/BSSID через `MainActivity.getCurrentWifiInfo` MethodChannel (defensive try/catch SecurityException + RuntimeException; placeholder BSSID `02:00:00:00:00:00` ловится как `unknown_ssid`). Permission missing → shared `WifiPermissionDialog`. `no_wifi` / `unknown_ssid` → snackbar.
  - **Pick saved** — bottom sheet с двумя секциями:
    - **USED IN YOUR RULES** — networks из других custom_rules с указанием rule names.
    - **HISTORY (last seen)** — `wifi_history` storage entries с relative time. Per-row 🗙 button (right-aligned, explicit hit-area) удаляет одну запись.
  - **Manual** — dialog с SSID + BSSID inputs (BSSID regex `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx` inline-validated).
  - **Save flow** — preflight permission check если есть wifi conditions (`BACKGROUND_LOCATION + NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`). При missing → shared `WifiPermissionDialog`, save проходит в любом случае (юзер мог нажать «Allow Wi-Fi info» runtime prompt).
  - **Zip/unzip semantics**: `_zipWifiEntries(chips) → (ssids, bssids)` для модели. Sing-box AND-ит списки независимо (cross-product). `_unzipWifiEntries` обратно при load (best-effort pairing by index).
- **§051 Phase 3 — Auto-record visited Wi-Fi networks** ([§051 spec Phase 3](docs/spec/tasks/051-custom-rule-wifi-conditions.md), [WifiNetworkObserver.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/WifiNetworkObserver.kt), [wifi_history_listener.dart](app/lib/services/wifi_history_listener.dart)). Opt-in toggle в `Settings → Diagnostics` (default OFF — silent network logging это privacy след). При ON `WifiNetworkObserver` регистрирует `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback(TRANSPORT_WIFI)`. Pending tracker записывает в `wifi_history` сети **на которых юзер пробыл ≥ 5 минут** (`STICKINESS_THRESHOLD_MS=300_000`) — отсекает drive-by кафе/магазины. Native → Dart bridge через `MethodChannel "com.leadaxe.lxbox/wifi_history"` event `onWifiSeen`. Pick saved bottom sheet показывает persistent info-banner «Auto-record is off — Open Settings» когда toggle OFF (visible сверху всегда). Existing history НЕ удаляется при OFF (user data). Cap 50, LRU evict по `last_seen`. Phase 4 (`WifiStateCache` для hot-path `readWIFIState`) — deferred до bench `dumpsys binder_calls_stats`, не оптимизируем вслепую.
- **Debug API — `/wifi_history/*` endpoints** ([wifi_history.dart](app/lib/services/debug/handlers/wifi_history.dart)) для CRUD над `wifi_history` без UI flow:
  - `GET /wifi_history` → list `[{ssid, bssid, last_seen}]`.
  - `POST /wifi_history` body `{"ssid":"...","bssid":"..."}` → upsert (BSSID auto lower-cased).
  - `DELETE /wifi_history` body `{"ssid":"...","bssid":"..."}` → remove specific entry (composite key match; idempotent).
  - `DELETE /wifi_history/all` → clear all.
  Same write-path что и UI (`SettingsStorage.addToWifiHistory` / `removeFromWifiHistory` / `clearWifiHistory`).

### Fixed

- **§051 Phase 2 — `wifi_history` not refreshing in Pick saved after row delete** ([settings_storage.dart](app/lib/services/settings_storage.dart)). `getWifiHistory` возвращал `toList(growable: false)`; `removeWhere` в setState callback'е молча кидал `UnsupportedError` на fixed-length list → UI rebuild не триггерился. Storage write проходил (entry удалена), но visible row оставалась до reopen sheet. Fix: `toList()` (growable).

### Refactor

- **§053 Stage 1 — extract pure functions + dialogs из `custom_rule_edit_screen.dart`** ([§053 spec](docs/spec/tasks/053-custom-rule-editor-split.md)). Editor разбух до 2060 LOC после §051. Stage 1 — низкорисковая extract'ция без architecture change:
  - **Pure functions**: `lib/screens/custom_rule_edit/validators.dart` (isValidDomain / isValidKeyword / isValidCidr / isValidPort / isValidPortRange / isValidUrl / isValidBssid) + `lib/screens/custom_rule_edit/normalizers.dart` (splitRaw / normalizedDomains / normalizedKeywords / normalizedCidrs / normalizedPorts / normalizedPortRanges). Были private методы на State — не тестируемы.
  - **Public `WifiEntry` model** ([wifi_entry.dart](app/lib/widgets/wifi_entry.dart)) — был private `_WifiEntry`.
  - **`showWifiSavedPickerSheet`** ([wifi_saved_picker_sheet.dart](app/lib/widgets/wifi_saved_picker_sheet.dart)) — self-contained: грузит other-rules + history + auto-record flag, показывает modal, возвращает `Future<List<WifiEntry>?>`. ~300 LOC inline `showModalBottomSheet` build'а уехали из editor.
  - **`showWifiManualAddDialog`** ([wifi_manual_add_dialog.dart](app/lib/widgets/wifi_manual_add_dialog.dart)) — same idea для Manual dialog.
  - **Editor**: 2060 → 1795 LOC (−265). Stage 2 (section widgets) + Stage 3 (state controller + tab split) — отдельные итерации.
  - **Tests**: +53 unit tests (validators + normalizers); 548 → 601 pass.
- **§051 closeout — consolidate wifi-read + permission-check** (`commit 20a4a51`). Three call-sites одной и той же defensive read logic (`PlatformInterfaceWrapper.readWIFIState` + `MainActivity.getCurrentWifiInfoMap` + `WifiNetworkObserver.readWifi`) consolidated в `WifiInfoReader` singleton с sealed `Result` type. Four copies permission-check (`if (SDK_INT >= X) checkSelfPermission(...) == GRANTED`) → `PermissionUtils.has(ctx, name, minSdk)` one-liner. Bonus: `_humanLastSeen` proper fallbacks, `WifiHistoryListener` `dispose()` lifecycle, `SettingsStorage` header convention note про growable lists.

### Performance

- **F22 part 2 — sing-box log forwarding pipeline production-grade** ([BoxService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxService.kt), [app_log.dart](app/lib/services/app_log.dart), [clash_log_pump.dart](app/lib/services/clash_log_pump.dart)). К drainer-pattern из v1.7.1 добавили back-pressure / yield / batching / O(1) deque / 60Hz throttle. На heavy traffic (100+ строк/сек) toggle «Forward sing-box logs» теперь почти free.
  - `@Synchronized` снят с `writeDebugMessage` — `LinkedBlockingQueue.offer` thread-safe, mutex только сериализовал producer-thread'ы Go runtime'а.
  - **Back-pressure cap** `LOG_QUEUE_MAX = 4096`: при slow Dart consumer'е drop newest вместо unbounded growth (counter `coreLogDrops`).
  - **Drainer yield** — до `DRAIN_BATCH_MAX = 200` строк за один main-looper run, потом re-post если queue не пуст. Длинный burst не блочит main looper > frame'а.
  - **EventChannel batching** — один `sink.success(List<String>)` за drain вместо per-line JNI marshal. На 200 строк/burst — 1 marshall вместо 200.
  - **AppLog ring buffer** — `List.insert(0)` (O(n)) → `ListQueue.addFirst` (O(1)). `logBatch()` — N entries за один проход + один `_scheduleNotify`.
  - **Notify throttle** 16ms (60Hz max) leading-edge — UI не ребилдится с frequency write'ов на busy traffic.

### UX (Statistics — Live tab tap-to-filter)

- **Tap по event row → in-place filter** ([live_events_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/live_events_tab.dart)). Раньше long-press открывал bottom sheet «Open in Per-app session» — юзер не хотел переключения на отдельный tab. Теперь:
  - Каждое поле строки кликабельное независимо: domain, IP:port, process. Tap → существующий search field заполняется выбранным значением, в-place фильтр.
  - Comma-list процессов разбит на индивидуальные tappable элементы (для multi-process events).
  - Повторный tap по тому же ключу — clear (escape hatch без отдельной кнопки).
- **Removed dead code**: `_handleJumpFromLiveTab` + `StatsScreen.requestPerAppSession` static helper удалены после снятия bottom sheet.

### UX (overflow menus cleanup)

- **Live tab + Per-app trace — 3-dot `Diagnostics settings` overflow удалена**. `CoreLogsHintBanner` (см. Changed выше) покрывает use-case с лучшей discoverability — visible когда нужен, без скрытия за overflow.
- **Tunnel apps — overflow link исправлен на System tab** ([tun_apps_tab.dart](app/lib/screens/tun_apps_tab.dart)). Раньше `VPN settings (Core)` вёл на `SettingsScreen(initialTab: 1)`. Per-app split-tunneling — это System-level фича (`VpnService.Builder` toggles), не Core (sing-box engine vars). Renamed to `VPN settings (System)`, ведёт на `initialTab: 0`.

## [1.7.2] — 2026-05-10

«§050 wifi-state closeout + Live tab fix» release. Главное — **закрыта §050**: F12.3 `readWIFIState` теперь полноценно работает, найден и исправлен real root cause `Unknown reference: 42` crash'а (unhandled `SecurityException` через JNI), плюс добавлены недостающие permissions для Android 13+ и runtime UX. Параллельно — фикс Live tab system-wide stats (раньше показывал 0 events) и UI toggle для §037 config lock.

### Fixed

- **§050 — F12.3 `readWIFIState` real root cause + final fix** ([§050 spec](docs/spec/tasks/050-libbox-debug-build/spec.md), [findings.md](docs/spec/tasks/050-libbox-debug-build/findings.md)). После 9 неудачных attempt'ов в §049 (различные констукторы / pinning / R8-keep-rules — все `Unknown reference: 42` cold-start) истинная причина оказалась проще, чем `Seq` ref-tracker race: **unhandled `SecurityException` propagating через JNI**.
  - Sing-box (Go) → cgo → `cproxy_PlatformInterface_ReadWIFIState` → Java callback `readWIFIState()` → `WifiManager.connectionInfo` → **`SecurityException`** при отсутствии location permission на API 29+ → exception проходит через JNI границу без handler в cproxy code → `Seq$RefTracker.incRefnum` пытается cleanup → **JNI env corrupted** → `ClassLinker::FindClass` fails → `Runtime::Abort` с misleading `"Unknown reference: 42"` (refnum 42 = follow-up effect, не cause).
  - **Defensive try/catch** `SecurityException + RuntimeException → return null` в `PlatformInterfaceWrapper.readWIFIState`. Sing-box graceful'но получает null (как было раньше когда метод всегда возвращал null) — как минимум не падает.
  - **Permission gate** в `BoxService.startSingbox` после `startOrReloadService` (port из reference SagerNet): `cs.needWIFIState() && !permission` → `stopAndAlert("alert:permission_location:...")`. Sing-box не запускается без permission'а если config реально использует `wifi_ssid`/`wifi_bssid` правила — Flutter показывает actionable alert вместо silent crash'а.
- **§050 — `<unknown ssid>` на Android 13+ (targetSdk≥33)**. Даже после grant'а `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` / `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`, `WifiInfo.ssid` возвращал `"<unknown ssid>"` → wifi rules не матчились. Google в API 33 отделил Wi-Fi info от location: для apps с `targetSdk≥33` нужен **отдельный `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`** permission ([Android docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/wifi/wifi-permissions)).
  - Manifest: `<uses-permission NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES neverForLocation>` (declared as not-for-location → Google Play политика).
  - `BoxService.startSingbox`: на API 33+ проверяются обе permission (`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` + `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`); alert содержит comma-list missing permissions для UI.
  - Verified on OnePlus / Android 15 / API 36: после grant'а wifi rule с `wifi_ssid:["lexRouter"], outbound: direct-out` корректно матчится — chrome → api.ipify.org идёт через direct, минуя VPN.

### Added

- **§050 — permission UX flows** ([home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart), [url_launcher.dart](app/lib/services/url_launcher.dart), [MainActivity.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/MainActivity.kt)).
  - **Notification permission explainer** при cold start: показывает explainer dialog ДО system POST_NOTIFICATIONS prompt'а — юзер понимает зачем VPN'у нужны notifications (foreground service / status indicator).
  - **Wi-Fi permissions dialog** при запуске VPN с wifi rules: parsит comma-list missing permissions, показывает кнопку `Allow Wi-Fi info` (runtime prompt для NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES — one tap) и `Open Settings` (для BACKGROUND_LOCATION который нельзя выдать через runtime prompt; идёт через `MANAGE_APP_PERMISSIONS` intent с тремя fallback стратегиями для разных OEM).
  - **Battery optimization — one-tap prompt**: primary action поменян с `ACTION_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATION_SETTINGS` (список всех apps) на `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` (системный диалог конкретно про L×Box). Список apps остаётся как fallback для OEM (ColorOS / MIUI / HyperOS) где direct-prompt молча отбрасывается.
- **§048 — Live tab system-wide events fix**. Раньше при тапе START в Live tab без per-app session показывалось 0 events — `_pollConnections()` имел early-return `if (_active == null) return`, и system-wide recording получал только DNS строки из core logs (TCP/UDP open/close — никогда). Теперь global recording тоже запускает `_startConnectionPoll()`, события через `_emitGlobalStream`. Closed connections тоже эмитятся в global buffer когда recording on. Idle profiler по-прежнему ничего не делает.
- **§037 — config_locked toggle в Diagnostics tab** ([app_settings_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/app_settings_screen.dart)). UI-эквивалент `PUT /settings/config_locked` Debug API endpoint'а: юзер может pin'нуть текущий sing-box config (например, после debug-API edit'а с экспериментальной фичей) от перезаписи UI-rebuild'ом, и снять lock сам. Auto-unlocks при отключении Debug API (иначе lock остаётся unactionable — toggle спрятан под Debug API блоком).

### Deferred

- **F22 part 2** — back-pressure cap (`LOG_QUEUE_MAX = 4096`) + drainer yield каждые 200 iterations + EventChannel batching (один `sink.success(list)` на batch вместо per-line) + AppLog ring buffer на deque вместо `List.insert(0)` + notifyListeners throttle до 60Hz. Текущий drainer pattern достаточен для production load, но на heavy debug-mode traffic возможно OOM risk при slow Dart consumer'е. Не release-blocker.

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-09

«Stabilization» release. Главное — **§049 sing-box wrapper deep audit + atomic CAS lifecycle fix**: устранена main suspect race condition по `fileDescriptor`, обнаруженная при диагностике §047 (TCP-deterioration после ~8 часов uptime). Параллельно — **§048 inclusive observer** для Per-app trace и **§046 tunnel apps split-tunneling**.

### Fixed

- **§049 sing-box wrapper deep audit + atomic CAS lifecycle fix** ([§049 spec](docs/spec/tasks/049-singbox-wrapper-deep-audit/spec.md), диагностика [§047](docs/spec/tasks/047-tun-tcp-deterioration-diagnosis.md)). Многочасовой side-by-side diff нашего Kotlin wrapper'а vs reference SagerNet/sing-box-for-android (correct commit `3b3883e` для libbox 1.13.11) → 25 findings, 9 применены как fix'ы. Главный — race condition в lifecycle `fileDescriptor`: `@Volatile` гарантирует publish, но не атомарность compound «read-then-close-then-null», и mutations из 5 call-site'ов (`openTun` / `cleanupStaleResources` / `onRevoke` / `doStop` / scope.cancel) могли привести к double-close → kernel переиспользует fd-int → sing-box пишет в чужой fd → silent ENXIO → TCP-traffic via tun перестаёт работать через 15-30 минут после старта.
  - **F2** Replaced `@Volatile var fileDescriptor` → `AtomicReference<ParcelFileDescriptor?>`. Helper `closeFileDescriptor()` использует `getAndSet(null)?.close()` — единственный поток получает non-null PFD, остальные no-op. Same для `commandServer`.
  - **F3** Удалён `cleanupStaleResources()` — superfluous 5-й mutation site, аналога в reference нет. AtomicReference helper'ы защищают от double-close без pre-cleanup'а. Также убрана `delay(500)` (была компенсацией для удалённого cleanup'а).
  - **F5** `onRevoke` cleanup переведён на atomic helpers (раньше мутировал поля inline на binder thread, race с `openTun` на libbox thread).
  - **F4** `serviceReload` без status-flap (Started→Starting→Started → без промежуточного broadcast'а), reference так и делает.
  - **F26** LocalResolver полностью переписан на `DnsResolver.getInstance().query(defaultNetwork, ...)` (port 1:1 из reference). Старый `InetAddress.getAllByName()` шёл через system resolver, который при `tun.auto_route=true` мог рекурсивно пройти ЧЕРЕЗ tun. Now bound к underlying network, мимо tun.
  - **F9** `Libbox.setLocale(Locale.getDefault())` в init — sing-box error messages теперь локализованы.
  - **F12.1** `userName` поле в `findConnectionOwner` — Clash API `/connections` теперь видит package name юзера.
  - **F17** `getSystemProxyStatus()` возвращает реальный state (раньше всегда empty `SystemProxyStatus()`) — Clash dashboard'ы видят корректные available/enabled флаги.
  - **F1 split** — `BoxVpnService` оставлен только как Android `VpnService + PlatformInterfaceWrapper` (PI), весь state и `CommandServerHandler` impl переехал в новый класс `BoxService` (plain Kotlin). `CommandServer(this, platformInterface)` создаётся теперь с **двумя разными Java instance** (port 1:1 из reference). Раньше `CommandServer(this, this)` шёл с одним объектом (CSH+PI шарили refnum=42 с refcnt=2), что увеличивало вероятность gomobile refcount race.
  - **Phase H — `BoxApplication` как зарегистрированный Android Application class** (`android:name=".vpn.BoxApplication"` в манифесте). Был `object BoxApplication` инициализирующийся лениво — теперь Android создаёт Application **до** Service/Activity, гарантируя что `Libbox.setup` отрабатывает до первого `CommandServer` ctor. Backward-compat callsite'ы `BoxApplication.X` работают через companion proxy на `instance`.
  - **Phase H — match reference deltas в init**: `Seq.setContext(this)` закомментирован (как в reference `Application.kt:41` — native libbox init сам устанавливает контекст; явный вызов делал двойной-set ломая `Seq$RefTracker`); `SetupOptions.logMaxLines = 3000` (без лимита sing-box копит логи unbounded).

#### Deferred / not applied

- **F12.3** `readWIFIState()` остаётся `null` (deferred). 9 attempts на нашем environment'е (Android 15 OnePlus + libbox 1.13.11 stripped) — constructor `WIFIState(s,b)`, factory `Libbox.newWIFIState`, cached singleton, Java strong-ref pin, drop `Seq.setContext`, drop `setMemoryLimit`, R8 keep rules, Phase H baseline — **все** падают `'Unknown reference: 42'` cold-start через 1-12 секунд. Java instrumentation patched `Seq$RefTracker` показал: refcnt не падает до 0 — Java side OK. Crash в native `libbox.so` cproxy который имеет собственный jobject hashmap отдельно от Java RefMap. Reference SagerNet с identical Java code на той же libbox 1.13.11 stable у людей. Без debug symbols (требует rebuild через `gomobile bind -ldflags="-w=false -s=false"` из sing-box source) диагностировать дальше нельзя — задача §050 на отдельную session. Practical impact: `wifi_ssid:` / `wifi_bssid:` правила в sing-box не работают (у нас в wizard их нет, юзеры не используют).
- **F22 coalesced log dispatch** — пробовали bounded queue + single-pending drainer вместо per-line `coreLogMainHandler.post`. Build 10104 (Lambda inline) работал; build 10106/10107 (тот же код по сути) — крашит refnum 42. Race-condition в interaction между Kotlin Lambda capture и gomobile/seq tracker. Не стабильно для prod — оставлен per-line dispatch.

### Added

- **§049 F15 — Allow VPN bypass toggle** (App Settings → «Allow VPN bypass»). Default off (strict tunnel — наш default behavior). Включает `Builder.allowBypass()` для VPN — apps могут explicit'но через `ConnectivityManager.bindProcessToNetwork(network)` обойти tun. Применяется при следующем `openTun()` (старт VPN или reload). Reference (`Settings.allowBypass`) имеет identical toggle.
- **Per-app trace — inclusive observer with confidence** ([§048 spec](docs/spec/tasks/048-perapp-trace-attribution-gaps.md)). Закрывает 13 attribution gap'ов в Per-app traffic profiler, выявленных в live-диагностической сессии 2026-05-09. Концепт: `TrafficProfiler` теперь не drop'ает события — каждое попадает в session с одним из 4 уровней `ConfidenceLevel` (`verified` / `secondary` / `inferred` / `unattributed`). Юзер видит **всё что произошло**, и видит **что точно его app, а что возможно**.
  - **Defensive DNS regex** — `_dnsRe` / `_dnsFailRe` принимают любой record type (HTTPS / SVCB / SOA / MX / TXT / unknown), любой формат timing'а (5ms / 10.0s), с/без trailing dot. Раньше `HTTPS` queries Chrome'а (HTTP/3 alt-svc discovery) silently дропались.
  - **Secondary packages** — `Session.secondaryPackages: Set<String>` configurable per session. Решает Tinkoff-WebView сценарий: target=`ru.tinkoff.investing` + secondary={`com.google.android.webview`} → WebView traffic попадает в session с `confidence=secondary`. UI: `Edit secondary` button под header'ом, multi-select picker.
  - **Multiple matching strategies** — direct package match → secondary packages → UID-stripped variants → recent DNS IP inference (10s window). Multi-package UID `com.google.android.gms, com.google.android.gsf` теперь split-and-contains, не equals.
  - **Pre-session backfill** — `_globalRollingBuffer` 60s × 3000 events always-running. На `start()` события за last 60s резолвятся через session matching и backfill'ятся в `session.events` с marker `〽 backfilled from pre-recording`. Решает «юзер ставит recording после того как заметил проблему — теряет первые 60s».
  - **Live system-wide tab** — 4-й tab в Statistics («Overview · Connections · Per-app · Live»). Discovery без выбора target: видно всё что происходит на устройстве в real-time. Filter chips (kind / unattributed-only / app multi-select / search by domain/IP/process), pause/resume, long-press → «Open in Per-app session for <pkg>» quick-discovery flow.
  - **Per-app Live sub-tab** — additional «System-wide events (no owner detected)» section внизу + красный banner «N unattributed events / 30s» когда detected attribution gaps (>5 за 30s).
  - **Time-based correlation cleanup** — `_connIdToMeta` / `_dnsByConnId` GC через `Timer.periodic(5s)` с TTL=30s, не count-based threshold (256). Закрывает conn-id reuse race window.
  - **Streaming primary, polling supplement** — polling interval 2s → 5s. Каждый `inbound packet connection` log line == event сразу; polling только enrich'ит open conn'ы (bytes / state) и эмитит close events.
  - **Debug API расширен**: `GET /profiler/live?seconds=60` (snapshot global rolling buffer), `GET /profiler/live/stream` (SSE без session filter'а), `GET /profiler/live/unattributed` (recent unattributed + banner state), `PATCH /profiler/secondary-packages` (live mutation), `POST /profiler/start { secondary_packages }` (initial set).
  - **API contract**: TrafficEvent JSON теперь включает `confidence`, `matched_via`, `shown_because`, `dns_record_type`, `backfilled` поля.
- **Tunnel apps — OS-level split-tunneling** ([§046 spec](docs/spec/tasks/046F-tunnel-apps-split-tunneling/spec.md)). Четвёртая вкладка в `Routing` для управления стандартным Android-механизмом split-tunneling: какие apps идут через VPN-tun, а какие — direct по cellular/wifi (минуя sing-box полностью).
  - **3 mode'а через SegmentedButton**: `Off` (все apps через tun, default) / `Allow-list` (только перечисленные через tun) / `Deny-list` (все КРОМЕ перечисленных). Mutually exclusive, как требует Android `VpnService.Builder` API.
  - **Storage** `tun_apps: {mode, packages}` в `lxbox_settings.json`. Default для existing юзеров: `{mode: "off", packages: []}` — backward-compat. Migration unconditional one-shot на первом load.
  - **Builder** `applyTunPackages()` в `post_steps.dart` (последний step pipeline'а): `mode: allow` → `inbound[tun].include_package`, `mode: deny` → `exclude_package`, `mode: off` → ничего не пишем.
  - **Native слой не трогали** — `BoxVpnService.kt:557-560` уже умеет читать `options.includePackage`/`excludePackage` от libbox и звать `VpnService.Builder.addAllowedApplication`/`addDisallowedApplication`. applies на `builder.establish()`.
  - **Restart banner** показывается при modified state + tunnel up (`addAllowedApplication` applies только при создании tun fd; light reload не помогает — нужен full VPN stop+start). Кнопка `[Restart now]` делает stop+start.
  - **Конфликт-tooltip ⓘ** на header'е tab'а: apps в Allow-list идут через tun → routing rules применяются нормально; apps вне Allow-list (или внутри Deny-list) bypass'ят VPN entirely → sing-box их не видит, custom rules с `package_name` не сматчатся.
  - **AppPicker reuse** — тот же multi-select picker что в §030/§044. Show-system-apps по default OFF.
  - **Uninstalled apps** помечаются greyed-icon + label `(uninstalled — auto-skipped)` (native ловит `NameNotFoundException`).
  - **Debug API** `GET /settings/tun_apps` / `PUT /settings/tun_apps` ({mode, packages}, replace целиком, package-name validation regex, dedup idempotent). Response `rebuild_needed: true` как hint клиенту.

### Tests

- `app/test/builder/tun_packages_test.dart` — 9 случаев `applyTunPackages` (off / off+pkgs / allow+empty / allow+pkgs / deny+pkgs / no tun / no inbounds / multiple tuns / TunAppsConfig predicates).
- `app/test/services/traffic_profiler_test.dart` — 16 новых тестов §048: defensive DNS regex (HTTPS / SVCB / SOA / `10.0s` time format / fail без owner), multi-package UID matching, WebView secondary, UID-suffix matching, non-target drop, secondary mutation, pre-session backfill, confidence in JSON, global snapshot, banner threshold, time-based GC.
- §049 — local APK build success, `flutter analyze` clean, **535 / 535 flutter tests pass**. On-device retest §047 race — pending (требует ~30+ min прогона на устройстве).

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-08

«Observability» release. Главное — **Per-app traffic profiler** (§044): inline-инструмент диагностики «куда конкретное приложение ходит и как роутится» прямо в Stats. Дополнено расширением `ru-direct` preset'а 4-слойной защитой (TLD + service-CDN suffix-list + GeoIP-ranges) — §045.

### Added

- **Per-app traffic profiler** ([§044 spec](docs/spec/tasks/044F-per-app-traffic-profiler/spec.md), [user guide](docs/features/per-app-trace.md)). Третий tab в Statistics: pick app → record → see DNS resolves (с CNAME chain'ом), connections (хост, IP, порт, outbound chain, bytes) и connection-issue markers ⚠ (DNS timeout, TCP RST early — locale-агностичные).
  - 4 sub-tab'а: **Live** (newest-first stream), **Domains** (aggregated, expandable с CNAME/IPs/outbound/issues), **IPs** (per-IP stats, ↗ jump к Domains), **Connections** (timeline с inline-expand).
  - In-memory only — никакого persist'а. 3h sliding window + 50k events count fallback. Ring-buffer 5 завершённых sessions.
  - **Recording indicator** ⚡: chip в `_buildTrafficBar` на HomeScreen с short package name, плюс ⚡ возле «Per-app» tab title в StatsScreen. Tap всей строки на Home → `StatsScreen(initialTab: perApp)`.
  - **Overflow menu** (⋮) Per-app tab'а: verbose toggle (debug-level core logs), copy/share session JSON, clear all, help.
  - **Debug API** (`/profiler/start`, `/profiler/stop`, `/profiler/active`, `/profiler/sessions`, `/profiler/session/<id>`, `/profiler/stream` SSE) для CLI-driven trace-flow'ов и автоматизации.
  - Connection-issue detection: 2 locale-агностичных типа — `dnsTimeout` (прямой engine-сигнал из `dns: exchange failed` лога) + `tcpReset` (heuristic «TCP закрылся <1с с 0 bytes»).
  - Process inference fallback: если sing-box не нашёл `package_name` для conn'а (webview, system process), атрибутируем по prior DNS resolved IP (10s window), помечаем 〽.
- **`docs/features/per-app-trace.md`** — полный user guide для Per-app traffic profiler: TL;DR, UI tour, 5 use cases (Tinkoff §045 / privacy audit / slow-app debug / preset catalog / dogfooding), Debug API curl-рецепты, edge cases, limits.
- **`docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`** + **`scripts/lxbox-diag.sh`** — playbook диагностики на устройстве и one-command snapshot всего runtime-state'а (Debug API + Clash API + adb-state) в `/tmp/lxbox-debug-<datetime>/` за 2-3 секунды. Для post-mortem'ов и pre-destructive-op baseline'ов.
- **`docs/TEMPLATE.md`** — полная схема `wizard_template.json` (catalog of presets/vars/sections) + vars-substitution syntax.

### Changed

- **`ru-direct` preset extended** ([§045 spec](docs/spec/tasks/045-ru-direct-geoip-fallback.md)). Теперь четыре слоя матчинга вместо одного:
  - **`ru-domains`** (TLD-based, было) — `.ru` / `.su` / IDN / `.moscow` / `.tatar`.
  - **`ru-services`** (новый inline rule_set) — 18 service-CDN suffix'ов российских компаний на не-RU TLD: `userapi.com` (VK), `avito.st`, `yandex.{net,com}`, `yastatic.net`, `2gis.com`, `okko.tv`, `premier.one`, `lenta.com`, `vk.com`, `vk-portal.net`, `gismeteo.com`, `lmru.tech`, `mradx.net`, `wbstatic.net`, `wildberries.by`, `trbcdn.net` (общий CDN Тинькофф+Сбер), `sberbank.com`. Проанализированы по WHOIS/AS — все RU-родные.
  - **`Ru Apps`** (package_name match, было) — для российских приложений у которых трафик может идти на любые TLD.
  - **`geoip-ru`** (новый remote `.srs` от runetfreedom) — IP-range fallback для CDN/QUIC/ECH/short-lived TCP, где первые три слоя могут пропустить (sniff race / package detection race / TLS 1.3 ECH). Гейтится через `geoip_enabled` var (default `true`); auto-download `.srs` через `RuleSetDownloader` (~150 KB, обновление 168h). Spec compliance §011.
  - `expandPreset` поддерживает `enabled: "@var"` гейтинг для rule_set entries (фрагмент пропускается при `false`) и `List<String>` форму `routing_rule.rule_set` (даунгрейд до single string при одном expanded tag'е, drop rule + warning при empty filtered list).
  - Existing v1.6.1 юзеры с включённым `ru-direct` preset получают `geoip_enabled = true` по default'у на ребилде → новый layer автоматически активируется без миграции storage.
- **README** + **README_RU**: feature card для Per-app traffic profiler в Features секции, screenshot `docs/screenshots/per_app_trace.jpg`.
- **`AppInfoCache`**: новый `loadAllApps()` (lightweight installed-apps list, populate per-package cache без иконок) + smart `ensure(pkg)` (если AppInfo в cache без icon'а — догружает только icon, а не полный info). Унифицирует icon-cache между Custom Rules и Per-app picker'ами.
- **`SseResponse`** в `debug/transport/response.dart` — primitive для Server-Sent Events через Debug API (используется `/profiler/stream`).

### Tests

- `app/test/services/traffic_profiler_test.dart` — session lifecycle (start/stop/auto-finalize), log-stream parsing (UID strip, CNAME chain, dns:cached + dns:exchanged), aggregation (DomainStats / IpStats), process inference (10s post-DNS window), connection-issue detection (2 types), session ring-buffer eviction.
- `app/test/services/builder/preset_expand_test.dart` — расширен под §045: 4 case'а для `geoip_enabled` × `geoip-ru` cache state (on+downloaded / on+not-downloaded / off+downloaded / off+not-downloaded), List form для `rule_set`, dangling-rule_set guard.
- `flutter analyze` чистый, **510 tests passed**.

### Release / CI

- Per-ABI APK split (продолжается с v1.6.1): `LxBox-v1.7.0-{arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,x86_64,universal}.apk`.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-05-08

DNS-серверы перевели на kind-discriminated refs (симметрия с DNS rules §061 dns-rules-refactor, бывший feature §041) с чистым разделением meta-полей и sing-box body — фиксит баги выявленные на v1.6.0 в эксплуатации.

### Changed

- **DNS servers: kind-discriminated refs + clean schema** ([§043](docs/spec/tasks/043-dns-servers-refs-by-kind.md) + [§044](docs/spec/tasks/044-dns-servers-clean-schema.md)). Storage `dns_options.servers[i]` хранит refs шейпа `{enabled, kind: inline|preset|template, tag, description?, body?}` — точно по образцу §061 DNS rules refactor (бывший feature §041).
  - **`tag` — single source of truth**: на ref-level. Для inline body **partial sing-box shape без** `tag`/`description`/`enabled` (они на ref-level, а sing-box эти meta-поля не использует). На build-time `body['tag'] = ref.tag` синтезируется в `config.dns.servers[i]` (запротоколированная магия в `resolveDnsServersBodies`).
  - **`description` на ref-level**: для inline — primary, для template/preset — optional override (если отсутствует, fallback на canonical's description).
  - **Body для template/preset берётся из canonical** by tag at render/build time. `kind: template` ref'ы автоматически подхватывают template-обновления (e.g. tag rename'ы от §060 libbox migration, бывший feature §039); orphan-cleanup на load удаляет ref'ы с несуществующими tag'ами.
  - **Override = `kind: inline` для tag'а с canonical** — без shape-comparison через `jsonEncode` (раньше order-sensitive фрагильно). Тривиальная classification по kind.
- **Короткие односложные badge'ы**: **Template** / **Preset** / **User** / **Overridden**. Раньше длинные «User (overrides template)» / «Preset · Russian domains direct» ломали title-wrap (живой баг на Yandex UDP — title разрывался на 4 строки).
- **Edit dialog: 3 явных input'а** — `Tag` / `Description` / `Enabled (Switch)` сверху, body JSON внизу (только sing-box-relevant поля **без** `tag`/`description`/`enabled`). Раньше юзер видел «магические» поля среди sing-box-полей.
- **Auto-discovery + orphan cleanup** в `resolveDnsServersList` — для каждого template/active-preset server'а tag которого нет в storage append'ится ref (с template's enabled default'ом / preset's default true); template/preset ref'ы с несуществующими tag'ами удаляются. Симметрично `resolveDnsRulesList` (§033 / §061 dns-rules-refactor, бывший feature §041).
- **UI: edit body на template/preset переводит entry в `kind: inline`** (copy-on-write). Reset (↺) убирает inline и возвращает kind на canonical; body+description удаляются. Add custom server создаёт `kind: inline` с user'овским body.
- **Builder consequences**: `applyCustomDns` теперь использует `resolveDnsServersList` (refs) + `resolveDnsServersBodies` (refs → final bodies для sing-box config). Старая XOR-логика «userServers OR templateServers» удалена.
- **Render layer typed**: новый `ResolvedServer` class в `dns_settings_screen.dart` — никаких underscore-полей в Map'ах (`_kind`/`_overrides`/`_preset_label`/`_origin` удалены полностью; компилятор гарантирует что они не протекут в JSON dump'ы).
- **One-shot migration** для existing v1.6.0 юзеров (one-shot, lossless). Auto-detect по presence/absence of `kind` field на entries:
  - **Pre-§043** (legacy full-body snapshot): classify by canonical match → kind-ref + peeled description на ref-level + partial body.
  - **§043 inline** (с tag/description в body, intermediate state): peel `body.description` → `ref.description`; drop `body.tag`/`body.enabled`/UI-annotations.
  - **§044 already-migrated**: no-op.
- **Debug API `PUT /settings/dns_options/servers`** принимает любой из трёх форматов (pre-§043 / §043 / §044). Detection auto'тический; legacy форматы конвертируются в §044 на ближайший resolver tick.
- **About screen — все 3 GitHub-tile теперь clickable** (Source Code → LxBox repo, VPN core → sing-box upstream, singbox-launcher Credits → upstream). Раньше копировали URL в clipboard — менее очевидно. Trailing `open_in_new` иконка для visual cue.

### Fixed

- **JSON viewer protokol leak** — `_showServerBodyDialog` показывал `_kind`/`_overrides` underscore-поля у одних tile'ов, не у других. Теперь `ResolvedServer.body` физически не содержит underscore-полей.
- **DNS Settings — Yandex/long-name preset tile разорван на 4 строки** (live-баг v1.6.0). Длинный badge `Preset · Russian domains direct` ломал title-wrap. Теперь badge короткий `Preset`, имя preset'а в subtitle.
- **Toggle enabled на template-сервере помечал его как Overridden** (live-баг). Storage хранил copy-on-write template-shape с изменённым `enabled`, override-detection через shape compare ошибочно классифицировала это как override. С refs-by-kind: toggle меняет только `enabled` ref'а, kind остаётся `template`, badge остаётся `Template`.
- **После §060 (libbox migration, бывший feature §039) tag rename `direct_dns_resolver` → `google_udp`** existing-юзеры не видели нового tag'а в DNS Final dropdown'е. Теперь auto-discovery подтягивает новый tag, orphan cleanup убирает старый.

### Tests

- `test/services/builder/dns_servers_resolver_test.dart` — `resolveDnsServersList` (orphan cleanup, auto-discovery, legacy migration); `resolveDnsServersBodies` (refs → bodies, enabled filter).

### Docs

- **`docs/STORAGE.md`** (новый) — единый источник правды по схеме `lxbox_settings.json`: top-level shape, per-key семантика, migration history (proxy_sources → server_lists, app_rules → custom_rules, dns_options.rules_json → rules[], pre-§043 → §043 → §044), SharedPreferences boot flags, Debug API exposure allow-list. `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5 свёрнут до tldr со ссылкой.

### Release / CI

- **Per-ABI + universal APKs** — релиз публикует 4 артефакта вместо одного fat-APK: `LxBox-vX.Y.Z-arm64-v8a.apk` (~32 MB, default для 95%+ устройств), `LxBox-vX.Y.Z-armeabi-v7a.apk` (старые / Android Go), `LxBox-vX.Y.Z-x86_64.apk` (эмуляторы / Chromebook), `LxBox-vX.Y.Z-universal.apk` (fat fallback ~95 MB). Уменьшает размер скачиваемого APK для большинства юзеров на ~3×. CI-инфраструктура запилена в `ci.yml` под этот релиз; v1.6.1 — первый релиз, который реально публикует все 4. Closes #4.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-07

«Диагностика + восстановление + DNS-cleanup» релиз. Под капотом — миграция на sing-box 1.13.x с переработкой нативного VPN-сервиса; видимое для юзера — light-recovery (Reload-кнопка / reset-network), per-group ping/test settings, понятные ошибки в banner'ах, починка DNS-маршрутов в РФ через ru-direct, backup/restore UI и всё, что ниже.

### Added

- **Backup & restore UI** ([§040 backup spec](docs/spec/tasks/040F-backup-restore-ui/spec.md), commit b332b21). Новый экран — экспорт/импорт пользовательских данных (server lists / routing rules / app settings / debug config) в JSON. 4 toggleable категории, dry-run preview перед применением, merge vs replace mode. Экспорт через `share_plus`, импорт через `file_picker`. Debug API: `GET /backup/export?include=...`, `POST /backup/import?merge=...`.
- **Reload-кнопка в AppBar** (commits 3f4cac7 / d5c709e / 23ff55b). Default tap = light reload core (`commandServer.startOrReloadService`) вместо полного reconnect — TUN не закрывается, in-place restart sing-box runtime'а с тем же config'ом. В long-press menu — отдельный пункт Reload как первый, recovery-фокус. Cooldown 3s между нажатиями (`canReload` getter в HomeController).
- **`/action/reset-network` Debug API** ([§031](docs/spec/tasks/031-reset-network-api.md)). Light recovery — `commandServer.resetNetwork()` без recreate'а box runtime / Service / TUN. Делает `connectionManager.CloseAll()` + DNS cache flush (`r.ClearCache()` + `transports.Reset()`) + interface refresh у inbound/outbound/endpoints. Spec обновлена с разбором по строкам исходника sing-box v1.13.11 (изначальная гипотеза «БЕЗ drop'а in-flight TCP» опровергнута — в реале all connections рвутся, но Service/TUN остаются стабильны).
- **Per-group ping/test settings + persist** ([§040](docs/spec/tasks/040-per-group-ping-test-settings.md)). Каждая VPN-группа может иметь свои `url` + `timeout_ms` для ping / mass-URLTest / group URLTest. Storage shape `ping_options: {url?, timeout_ms?, groups: {<groupTag>: {url?, timeout_ms?}}}` симметричен template'у. Resolve chain: per-group override → global storage → template default. Global `pingUrl`/`pingTimeout` теперь тоже **persist'ятся** (раньше жили только в памяти controller'а — на restart сбрасывались). UI dialog «Ping settings» с SegmentedButton «All groups | <currentGroup>» + Reset-to-global. Debug API endpoints: `GET/PUT /settings/ping_options`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /settings/ping_options/groups/{tag}`. Use-case: VPN-1 (foreign-routed) — gstatic 204; VPN-2 (РФ-direct) — ya.ru.
- **Sing-box internal logs в Debug API** ([§043](docs/spec/tasks/043F-applog-per-source-quotas/spec.md)). `GET /logs/core` показывает router/dns/inbound/outbound события sing-box'а — для диагностики bug-репортов («после wake direct/auto не работает» и т.п.). Source delivery: `PlatformInterface.writeDebugMessage` → `EventChannel("lxbox/coreLog")` → `ClashLogPump` (новый `lib/services/clash_log_pump.dart`) → `AppLog` как `DebugSource.core`. Уровень парсится regex'ом (`\bWARN\b`/`\bERROR\b` etc.) — TRACE/DEBUG отбрасываются на native (volume reduction). ANSI escape codes стрипаются. **Toggle:** `PUT /settings/core_logs_enabled {"enabled":true}` (default false; storage в SharedPreferences `boxvpn_boot.core_logs_enabled` потому что `Libbox.setup` читает значение до Flutter engine; изменение применяется только после force-stop приложения). UI-toggle единственный — App Settings → Diagnostics. Shortcut в DebugScreen: ⋮ menu → "Diagnostics settings".
- **AppLog per-source quotas** ([§043](docs/spec/tasks/043F-applog-per-source-quotas/spec.md)). Раньше единый ring-buffer на 500 entries — sing-box (verbose, сотни строк/мин) вытеснял app-сообщения за минуты. Теперь `Map<DebugSource, List>`: `app=300`, `core=500`, независимые ring-buffer'ы. K-way merge на чтении (insert O(1) amortized), `entriesForSource(s)` direct lookup. Persistent split: `applog.txt` + `corelog.txt`, по 200 lines / 64KB каждый — `initPersistent()` грузит оба. Debug API: `GET /logs/app`, `GET /logs/core` aliases; `POST /logs/clear?source=app|core` per-source clear.
- **Debug API: write `config.json` direct + lockable rebuild** ([§037](docs/spec/tasks/037-debug-api-write-config-and-lock-rebuild.md)). `PUT /config` с raw sing-box JSON — sing-box reload'ится. `PUT /settings/config_locked {"locked": true}` — pin'ит config от UI-rebuild'ов (`SubscriptionController.generateConfig()` возвращает null silently пока lock держится). Use-case: тестировать sing-box фичи которые наш parser/builder не понимает (Tailscale outbound и т.п.). Endpoints: `PUT /config`, `GET /state/config_locked`, `PUT /settings/config_locked`. Storage: `config_locked_for_debug`, default false.
- **Core version в About** (commit 3f4cac7). About dialog показывает версию sing-box core (`commandServer.coreVersion()`) рядом с app version — сразу видно какой libbox прошит.
- **Universal error format helper** ([§041](docs/spec/tasks/041-user-error-format-helper.md)). Новый `lib/services/error_format.dart` с `formatUserError(Object e)` — превращает Dart exception toString'ы в человекочитаемый текст. Поддерживает `TimeoutException` → `timeout Ns`, `SocketException`/`FileSystemException` → `osError.message`, `FormatException` → `e.message`, `ClashHttpException` → `HTTP <code>`, `PlatformException` → `e.message ?? "platform error: <code>"`, fallback strip+truncate. Применено в 7 user-visible callsite'ах HomeController (file pick, start/stop/reconnect VPN, Clash API refresh, switch node) + snackbar'ах 6 экранов. 12 unit-тестов. Примеры:
  - `PlatformException(start_failed, "vpn_service.prepare returned false", null, null)` → `vpn_service.prepare returned false`
  - `SocketException("Failed lookup", OSError("Connection refused", 61), ...)` → `Connection refused`
  - `FileSystemException("Cannot open file", "/p", OSError("No such file or directory", 2))` → `No such file or directory`

### Changed

- **libbox: 1.12.12 → 1.13.11** ([§060 libbox migration](docs/spec/tasks/060-libbox-1-13-migration/spec.md), commit 913530b). Перешли на актуальный major-релиз sing-box. Ключевые архитектурные перемены подкапотом:
  - **`BoxService` класс удалён в 1.13** — всё его API поглощено в `CommandServer`. Единый `CommandServer` владеет runtime'ом через `startOrReloadService(config, opts)`. Two-phase shutdown (`closeService()` → `close()`).
  - **`PlatformInterface` упрощён**: убраны `writeLog`, `packageNameByUid`, `uidByPackageName` — sing-box сам ведёт UID→package mapping и отдаёт через richer `ConnectionOwner` struct (`userId`, `userName`, `processPath`, `androidPackageNames[]`).
  - **`Seq.destroyRef` больше не вызываем** — Go runtime в 1.13 self-cleans refnum'ы; manual destroyRef = double-free.
  - **Two-phase shutdown на `Dispatchers.IO`** — `closeService()` (остановить runtime; throwing → `setError`), потом `close()` (закрыть Unix-socket; non-throwing). Перепутать = Go callbacks могут зависнуть → ANR.
- **Dart wrapper cleanup** (`box_vpn_client.dart`):
  - `getVpnStatus()`/`onStatusChanged` возвращают типизированный `TunnelStatus`/`TunnelStatusEvent` вместо `String`/`Map<String,dynamic>`.
  - `BackgroundMode` enum (был `String`).
  - `AppInfo` model — типизированный класс в `lib/models/app_info.dart`.
  - **MethodChannel timeouts** на критических вызовах — `getVpnStatus` (3s), `startVPN` (30s), `stopVPN` (10s), `getInstalledApps` (15s).
  - `BoxVpnClient.I` singleton + `BoxVpnClient.forTest()` factory.
  - Method-name константы (`_Methods.saveConfig` etc.).
- **Empty template DNS catch-all** ([§039 task](docs/spec/tasks/039-empty-template-dns-rules.md)). Убрали template-level правило `{name: "Default → Google DoH", server: google_doh}` — всё что не матчится preset/inline DNS-правилами теперь идёт через `dns.final` (= `@dns_final`, default `local_dns_resolver` = system resolver через PlatformInterface; юзер может override'нуть в wizard'е). Причина: `google_doh` (HTTPS/443) на long-idle деградирует — DoH connection pool stale → re-dial фейлится → fall-through DNS умирает (наблюдалось 2× за неделю). System resolver state-less, не подвержен. Tooltip `dns_final` обновлён. Existing-юзеры с записью «Default → Google DoH» — orphan cleanup в `resolveDnsRulesList` сам уберёт. Также: tag `direct_dns_resolver` → `google_udp` (симметрия с `cloudflare_udp`).
- **DNS settings dropdown'ы видят preset-серверы** ([§039 task](docs/spec/tasks/039-empty-template-dns-rules.md)). `_enabledServerTags` getter в `dns_settings_screen.dart` объединяет два источника: template/user-saved (`_servers`) + preset-expanded (`_presetServersWithLabel`, e.g. `yandex_udp` от ru-direct). До fix'а dropdown показывал только template+user; preset-добавленные теги не появлялись. Затронутые dropdown'ы: DNS Final / Default Domain Resolver / per-rule server selector.
- **`ru-direct` preset: DNS defaults сменили на UDP/Base** ([§038](docs/spec/tasks/038-ru-direct-dns-defaults.md)). Был `yandex_doh` (HTTPS/443) с IP `77.88.8.88` (Safe-tier). Стал `yandex_udp` (UDP/53) с IP `77.88.8.8` (Base-tier). Причина: у части юзеров (особенно `outbound = direct-out` или WG-router в РФ) Yandex DoH endpoint на `:443` режется ISP/router-DPI: TLS handshake до `safe.dot.dns.yandex.net` зависает, ICMP/UDP при этом работают. Все `.ru` lookups через `ru-direct` failed → `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` в браузере и mobile-apps на ya.ru / t-bank-app.ru. UDP/53 на 77.88.8.8 универсально пропускается. Tooltip `dns_server` укоротили; options в `dns_ip` и `dns_servers` упорядочили — Base/UDP идут первыми. **Существующие установки не затронуты**: явно сохранённые `vars_values` приоритетнее template-default'а.
- **DNS rules: schema cleanup** ([§061 dns rules refactor](docs/spec/tasks/061-dns-rules-refactor/spec.md) + [§032](docs/spec/tasks/032-dns-rules-schema-symmetry.md) + [§033](docs/spec/tasks/033-unified-kind-vocabulary.md)). Унификация discriminator: `dns_options.rules[i].type` → `kind`. Унификация vocabulary: `inline | srs | preset | template` для DNS rules — общая лексика с `custom_rules`. Для `kind: preset` хранится `presetId` вместо mutable `title=preset.label`. Field rename `title` → `name` для kind=inline/template — симметрия с `custom_rules.name`. Auto-link при создании / mandatory link при удалении: добавление `custom_rules.kind:preset` автоматически создаёт соответствующую `dns_options.rules.kind:preset` запись. **Independent enable** route-aspect ↔ DNS-aspect. **No migration** — legacy ключи silently dropped, auto-discovery восстанавливает fresh state.
- **Action endpoints: unified `/action/urltest`** ([§040](docs/spec/tasks/040-per-group-ping-test-settings.md)). Раньше три endpoint'а: `/action/ping-node?tag=`, `/action/ping-all`, `/action/run-urltest?group=`. Теперь один `/action/urltest` со scope-dispatch'ем через query: `?tag=` (single node), `?group=` (group urltest), `?all=true` (mass urltest). HomeController методы: `pingNode` → `runNodeUrltest`, `pingAllNodes` → `runMassUrltest`, `runGroupUrltest` без изменений. **Breaking** для adb-скриптов которые звали старые endpoints — alias'ы не оставлены.
- **URLTest error format: human-readable** ([§040](docs/spec/tasks/040-per-group-ping-test-settings.md)). `runNodeUrltest` / `runGroupUrltest` форматируют ошибки через `_formatProbeError` (built on top of `formatUserError` из §041):
  - Было: `Ping: TimeoutException after 0:00:10.000000: Future not completed`
  - Стало: `direct-out → ya.ru — timeout 5.8s` / `direct-out → ya.ru — HTTP 503` / `direct-out → ya.ru — connection refused`
- **Clash delay/groupDelay timeout sync** ([§040](docs/spec/tasks/040-per-group-ping-test-settings.md)). Раньше Dart-side wrapper использовал hardcoded `_timeout = 10s` независимо от `timeoutMs` query-param'а. Если юзер ставил `timeout_ms=5000` — dart-сторона всё равно ждала 10s, ловила TimeoutException вместо нормального clash response. Теперь `Duration(milliseconds: timeoutMs) + _delayResponseBuffer` где `_delayResponseBuffer = 750ms` (cleanup-buffer на стороне sing-box). Применено в `delay()` и `groupDelay()`.
- **`wizard_template.json`**: убрано невалидное поле `"format": "domain_suffix"` из inline rule_set'а `ru-domains`. Sing-box тихо обнулял его и в 1.12, и в 1.13, но в `option/rule_set.go` для inline-варианта это поле не определено — будущий sing-box 1.14+ может ужесточить и сделать hard reject.

### Fixed

- **Clash delay endpoint hang после ~27 минут аптайма** (root-cause [§060 libbox migration](docs/spec/tasks/060-libbox-1-13-migration/spec.md)). Симптом: все ноды в server-list show "err" в UI после 28-30 минут активной VPN-сессии, при том что трафик через выбранную ноду продолжает работать. Root cause — DNS cache dedup-lock goroutine leak в sing-box `dns/client.go:144-164`: per-question wait канал блокировался **без** `ctx.Done()`-awareness; первый раз когда upstream DNS-transport замёрз, все последующие waiter'ы парковались навсегда. Fix — upstream commit `aba8346b`, вошёл в sing-box `v1.12.21+` и `v1.13.0+`.
- **Mass ping cancel actually cancels** ([§034](docs/spec/tasks/034-mass-ping-cancel-actually-cancels.md)). Раньше Stop во время mass ping'а оставлял три side-effect'а: спиннеры висели до timeout'а у нод которые не успели ответить (worker break без cleanup pingBusy state'а); `_runAllUrltestGroups` после workers крутил `auto`-группу до конца независимо от cancel'а; in-flight HTTP delay/groupDelay запросы продолжали выполняться. Fix: `cancelMassPing` теперь (1) очищает `pingBusy` целиком; (2) `_runAllUrltestGroups(epoch)` проверяет epoch на каждой итерации; (3) `ClashApiClient` имеет отдельный `_delayHttp` клиент — `cancelDelays()` его close'ит, in-flight HTTP-сокеты рвутся.

### Build / CI

- **APK размер: ~73 MB → ~56 MB** (commit da709a3). CI собирает **arm64-v8a single-arch** APK (`flutter build apk --release --target-platform android-arm64`) — то же что и локальная сборка через `scripts/build-local-apk.sh`. Раньше CI собирал fat-APK с тремя ABI; `libbox.so` (~17 MB) дублировался на каждую ABI.
  - Покрытие: arm64-v8a — 95%+ современных Android-устройств. Android 14+ Google запретил 32-bit-only платформы.
  - Не покрывает: `armeabi-v7a` only Android Go бюджет — вне целевой аудитории VPN-клиента.
  - **v1.5.0 (предыдущий)** — последний релиз с fat APK ~73 MB. v1.6.0+ — arm64-only ~56 MB.

### Documentation

- **Постоянная карта обновления документации** ([`docs/spec/README.md`](docs/spec/README.md)). Каждая спека (фича/задача) теперь должна явно перечислять раздел `## Docs to update` со списком конкретных entries: какие из стандартных файлов (`debug-api-reference.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md` + `releases/vX.Y.Z.md`, `pubspec.yaml`, `DEVELOPMENT_REPORT.md`) обновляются вместе с кодом. Backfill в spec'ах §035-§041, §043. Имплементационная фаза не считается завершённой пока соответствующие docs-обновления не сделаны.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- **NaïveProxy** ([§037](docs/spec/tasks/037F-naive-proxy/spec.md), [#2](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/2)) — парсер `naive+https://` URIs (DuckSoft), генератор sing-box `type: "naive"` outbound'а, share-URI round-trip. 10-й протокол в Parser v2. Cronet/`with_naive_outbound` уже в `libbox.aar` — без APK-size impact. +36 тестов; suite 373 → 409 ✓.
- **Quick Connect: QS tile + home-screen shortcut** ([§032](docs/spec/tasks/032F-quick-connect/spec.md), [#1](https://github.com/Leadaxe/LxBox/issues/1)) — две точки toggle VPN без открытия app'а. Tile синхронизирован с `BoxVpnService.currentStatus`, shortcut на launcher-иконке. Первый раз app коротко открывается ради `VpnService.prepare(...)` consent — Android API ограничение. См. [task 014](docs/spec/tasks/014-quick-connect-tile-shortcut.md).
- **Crash diagnostics** ([§038](docs/spec/tasks/038F-crash-diagnostics/spec.md)) — четыре независимых канала post-mortem диагностики:
  - **A. stderr-redirect** — `Libbox.redirectStderr` пишет Go panic-stacktrace в `filesDir/stderr.log` до SIGABRT'а. Условная вкладка `stderr` в Debug-экране (только если файл непустой), кнопка Share. [task 018](docs/spec/tasks/018-stderr-viewer-debug-tab.md).
  - **B. ApplicationExitInfo** (API 30+) — `getHistoricalProcessExitReasons` lazy-читается в `DumpBuilder`. Reason + tombstone (для CRASH_NATIVE) или JVM stacktrace (для CRASH). [task 029](docs/spec/tasks/029-application-exit-info.md).
  - **C. Persistent AppLog** — `warning` + `error` уровни пишутся в `filesDir/applog.txt` (ring-buffer 200 строк / 64KB). На старте `main()` подгружаются с `fromPreviousSession=true`. Pre-crash JVM-events переживают рестарт. [task 028](docs/spec/tasks/028-persistent-applog.md).
  - **D. Logcat tail** — `Runtime.exec("logcat", "-d", "-t", 1000, "*:E")` через `ProcessBuilder` (без `READ_LOGS` permission, logd UID-фильтрует сам). Ловит `AndroidRuntime FATAL EXCEPTION`, `libc`/`DEBUG`/`tombstoned`, `art`/`linker` — особенно когда AEI не приложил trace (Samsung One UI quirk на REASON_CRASH). [task 022](docs/spec/tasks/022-logcat-tail-in-dump.md).
  - `DumpBuilder` отдаёт все 4 канала одним JSON-pack'ом (поля `stderr_log`, `exit_info`, `logcat_tail`, plus `debug_log` с persistent-маркером).
- **Debug API: `/diag/*` endpoints group** ([§031](docs/spec/tasks/031F-debug-api/spec.md)) — `/diag/dump`, `/diag/exit-info`, `/diag/logcat`, `/diag/stderr`, `/diag/applog`. Всё что отдаётся в UI ⤴ Share, доступно через HTTP без UI.
- **Debug API: `/backup/*` group** ([task 026](docs/spec/tasks/026-backup-export-import.md)) — `GET /backup/export?include=config,vars,subs` и симметричный `POST /backup/import?merge=&rebuild=`. Pure-data snapshot (без diag-шума), совместим с форматом `/diag/dump`. Кеши (cache.db, stderr.log, SRS, runtime nodes) не входят — restore их пересоздаст из подписок.
- **Debug API: `POST /action/preview-empty-state?on=true|false`** ([task 025](docs/spec/tasks/025-preview-empty-state.md)) — UI-only override: `HomeScreen` рендерит empty-state как при чистой инсталляции, реальные данные не трогаются. Полезно для скриншотов / regression-теста UX без `pm clear`.

### UX

- **Home empty-state guide** ([task 024](docs/spec/tasks/024-home-empty-state-cta.md)). Два состояния:
  - **Нет конфига** (`configRaw.isEmpty`): «Add a server» + крупная круглая `+`-кнопка → `SubscriptionsScreen`. `_buildControls` скрыт — стартовать нечего, disabled-кнопка только запутывала.
  - **Конфиг есть, не подключены**: вместо пассивного «Tap Start to connect» — большая кликабельная зона с иконкой play (64dp, primary color) и текстом «Tap to connect». Тап стартует VPN тем же путём что и FilledButton в _buildControls.

### Fixed

- **`CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE` permission на Android 9-11** ([task 023](docs/spec/tasks/023-change-network-state-permission.md)). `DefaultNetworkListener` на API 28-30 зовёт `ConnectivityManager.requestNetwork(...)`, который требует `CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE`. Без него — `SecurityException` → `REASON_CRASH` сразу после VPN-consent OK на A50/A10/Y9. На API 31+ используется `registerBestMatchingNetworkCallback` (без этого требования) — поэтому регрессия проявлялась только на 9-11.
- **VLESS `packetEncoding` allow-list** — xray-style подписки кладут в URI `packetEncoding=none`, что выдаёт `"packet_encoding": "none"` в outbound JSON; sing-box `vless.NewOutbound` принимает только `xudp`/`packetaddr`/omitted, для прочего зовёт `E.New("unknown packet encoding: …")` и крашит libbox через апстрим-баг в `format.ToString`. Парсер нормализует на входе: `xudp`/`XUDP` → `xudp`, `PacketAddr` → `packetaddr`, `none` дропается, прочее → warning + дроп. См. [task 012](docs/spec/tasks/012-vless-packet-encoding-libbox-panic.md), [PROTOCOLS.md](docs/PROTOCOLS.md).
- **Race: `Libbox.newService` до завершения `Libbox.setup`** ([task 027](docs/spec/tasks/027-libbox-init-race-fix.md)) — `BoxApplication.libboxReady: CompletableDeferred<Unit>` барьер; `serviceScope.launch` в `BoxVpnService` ждёт его до любого libbox-вызова. Параллельно: `workingDir` libbox переехал из external (`getExternalFilesDir(null)`) в internal (`context.filesDir`) — там же где SettingsStorage и подписки; убирает Knox/SELinux edge-case'ы.
- **Quick Connect class-verification на Android 9-11** ([task 015](docs/spec/tasks/015-android-9-11-quickconnect-regression.md)) — `Tile.subtitle` (API 29+) в `@RequiresApi(Q)` helper, `LxBoxTileService.refreshTile` / `QuickShortcuts.refresh` gated на API 30+ с outer `try { Throwable }`, все callsites в `setStatus`/`onDestroy`/`initialize` обёрнуты в `runCatching`. `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` permission гейтнут `minSdkVersion="34"`; typed `startForeground` на API 34+.

### Reliability

- **`Libbox.newService` / `svc.start` / `serviceScope.launch` ловят `Throwable`** ([task 016](docs/spec/tasks/016-libbox-newservice-throwable-catch.md)) — не только `Exception`; `Error`-наследники (OOM, NoClassDefFoundError, VerifyError) теперь идут через понятный `stopAndAlert(...)` вместо тихого вылета.

### Earlier in v1.5.0 cycle (2026-04-23 carryover)

#### Breaking

- **Tunnel sleep mode default: `lazy` → `never`.** Раньше tunnel поведение было захардкожено: `pause()` на deep Doze + `wake()` при выходе (паттерн sing-box-for-android). При Doze ломались длинные TCP-сокеты и push-уведомления — юзеры жаловались «интернет отваливается пока не открою app». Новый дефолт `never` держит тоннель всегда активным, что увеличивает расход батареи (ориентировочно +1–3% за ночь) в обмен на стабильность push'ей и SIP/VoIP. Кто хочет старое поведение — Settings → Background → Tunnel sleep mode → **Lazy sleep**. Миграция silent: существующие установки получают новый дефолт без диалога, настройка доступна из UI.

#### Reliability

- **Tunnel sleep mode (3-way setting)** — App Settings → Background → «Tunnel sleep mode». Три режима: `never` (default, tunnel всегда активен), `lazy` (pause только при deep Doze), `always` (pause при каждом screen-off, максимум экономии батареи). Хранение в `BootReceiver` SharedPreferences (`background_mode`), применяется при следующем подключении VPN. Реализация: [BoxVpnService.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BoxVpnService.kt), [BootReceiver.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/BootReceiver.kt), [VpnPlugin.kt](app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/leadaxe/lxbox/vpn/VpnPlugin.kt), [box_vpn_client.dart](app/lib/vpn/box_vpn_client.dart), [app_settings_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/app_settings_screen.dart).

#### UX

- **Tabbed App Settings** — 3 таба: **General** (appearance, behavior, subscriptions, feedback), **Background** (keep-on-exit, battery opt, notifications, OEM, sleep mode), **Diagnostics** (permissions summary, Debug API). Keep-on-exit перенесён из Startup в Background.
- **Battery-optimization попап на старте** — если `isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations == false`, HomeScreen показывает AlertDialog «Разрешите работу в фоне» с кнопкой перехода в системные настройки. Rate-limit: не чаще 1 раза в 24 часа (`battery_opt_last_prompt_ms` в SettingsStorage). Реализация: [home_screen.dart](app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart).
- **Notifications-status индикатор** в App Settings → Background. Если нотификации запрещены — красная иконка + tap открывает per-app notification settings. Важно для Android 13+ где `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` runtime-permission: без неё foreground service работает, но notification не рендерится → OS охотнее throttle'ит FGS. Native API: `NotificationManagerCompat.areNotificationsEnabled()` + `Settings.ACTION_APP_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS`.

- **Update check on launch** ([§036](docs/spec/tasks/036F-update-check/spec.md)) — `UpdateChecker` сервис: через 5s после старта app'а пингует `api.github.com/repos/Leadaxe/LxBox/releases/latest` (24h cap, default ON, single-line disclosure). Если новый релиз → `SnackBar` в HomeScreen с кнопками **View** (открывает release page в браузере) / **Not now** (dismiss per-tag). Sideload flow без in-app installer. About screen: блок «Latest available» с manual `[Check now]`. App Settings → General → Updates: toggle + last-check + manual button.

#### Debug API

- **`GET /help[?format=text|json]`** — self-documenting capability map. Без auth (как `/ping`). Markdown-text для LLM-агентов, structured JSON для auto-tooling. Hand-maintained в `handlers/help.dart` — single source of truth для wrappers / шпаргалок.

#### Process

- **Night-work autonomous process** (`docs/spec/processes/night-work/`) — canonical spec, startup-prompt, report-template, morning-review, scripts/session-start.sh. Anti-pattern'ы из 2026-04-22 retro зашиты в spec (no silent pivot, no megacommit WIP rescue, no hallucinated marketer stats).
- **MCP server design** ([§035](docs/spec/tasks/035F-mcp-server/spec.md), draft) — план обёртки Debug API в MCP server (stdio, TS+Node, tools/resources/prompts). Implementation отложена до момента когда Claude Desktop станет primary tooling surface.

#### Tests

- `test/vpn/box_vpn_client_test.dart` — MethodChannel contract tests для новых обёрток (`setBackgroundMode`, `getBackgroundMode`, `areNotificationsEnabled`, `isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations`). 4 теста.
- `test/services/update_checker_test.dart` — 10 unit-тестов на pure-function `isNewer` (semver compare, malformed input, suffix stripping).

#### Scripts

- `scripts/install-apk.sh` — auto-detect устройство (wifi > USB), install + force-stop + launch + restore Debug API forward (port 9269).
- `scripts/ensure-wifi-adb.sh` — check / bootstrap wifi-adb (tcpip + connect from USB device).

## [1.4.2] — 2026-04-22

### Design

- **Новая иконка приложения** — W1 "routing cross" вместо generic Flutter-иконки. Android (adaptive foreground/background + themed mono для Android 13+), iOS, macOS, web favicon, Windows — все платформы единовременно. Концепт отражает метафору маршрутизации по правилам. Источники SVG в `docs/design/icon/W1_pack/` (см. [spec 034](docs/spec/tasks/034F-app-icon/spec.md)).

### Cleanup

- Удалён `docs/design/icon-exploration/` — прочие отклонённые концепты (W2 Lx-monogram, W3 iso-cube, 10 черновиков). История в git, финальный winner перемещён в `docs/design/icon/W1_pack/`.

---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-04-22

### Reliability

- **Retry + exponential backoff** для subscription fetch (`sources.dart`) и rule_set download (`rule_set_downloader.dart`): 3 попытки с задержками 1s → 3s. `4xx` — permanent (без ретраев), `5xx` / timeout / `SocketException` — retry. Снимает основную массу жалоб "подписка не обновляется" у юзеров с флапающей сетью.
- **Top-level error boundary** — `FlutterError.onError` + `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` → `AppLog`. Uncaught-ошибки видны на Debug → Logs. Красный экран заменён на компактный `ErrorBoundary` fallback-widget.
- **Auto-updater spam-gate tests** (§027) — покрыто тестами: `consecutiveFails`, `minRetryInterval`, `maxFailsPerSession`, `inProgress` crash-safe reset при старте app.

### Security

- **URL masking audit** — subscription URL больше не попадают в `AppLog` целиком. Везде `maskSubscriptionUrl` (`scheme://host/***`). Полный URL доступен только в Debug API с `reveal=true`. Закрыты 4 leak-сайта: hydrate-fail, `inProgress` skip warning, shortUrl truncation, `addFromInput`.

### UX

- **Human-readable errors** (`humanizeError`) — все user-visible сообщения приведены к человеческому виду. Было: `Exception: HTTP 503 for https://…`. Стало: `Server error (503) — provider is down, try later`. `TimeoutException` сообщает длительность. Покрыт топ-5: subscription fetch, rule-set download, parse, config build, VPN start.
- **Parse hints** — если подписка загружена но распарсилась в 0 нод, показываем причину (HTML-страница, Clash YAML, full sing-box config, plain-text error).
- **Pull-to-refresh** на Subscriptions screen (`RefreshIndicator` → `updateAll`).
- **Getting Started card** — карточка для пустого списка подписок: варианты URL / paste clipboard / file.
- **Unsaved-input guard** — Add Subscription: введённый текст + back → диалог "Discard input?".
- **Relative time** — `2h ago / yesterday / 3d ago / 2w ago / 2mo ago / 2y ago` вместо абсолютных timestamp'ов.
- **Reset fail-count & retry** — long-press на подписке → action размораживает `consecutiveFails` и сразу обновляет.
- **Share URL (masked / full)** — long-press → диалог с выбором masked/full URL.
- **Debug logs search** — `/logs` endpoint поддерживает `q=` substring search и `level=` multi-filter (`error,warn`). `/action/emulate-error` для demo `humanizeError`.

### Testing

- **262 → 359 тестов** (+97). Новые модули покрыты полностью: `error_humanize`, `url_mask`, `parse_hints`, `relative_time`, `input_helpers`, `http_cache`, `rule_set_downloader`, `auto_updater`, `body_decoder`, validator edge cases, preset-expand.

### Cleanup

- `flutter analyze`: 20 info/warning → **0**. `@override` аннотации на subclass fields, удалены избыточные `!`.
- Dispose + dead-code audit — чисто (без правок). `setDebugLastError` leak устранён в `/action/emulate-error`.

### Changed — `CustomRule` sealed-split (spec 030 §v1.4.1, task 011)

- **`CustomRule` разделён на sealed-иерархию** с тремя подклассами:
  - `CustomRuleInline` — юзерские match-поля (domain/suffix/keyword/cidr/port/package/protocol/private-ip + outbound).
  - `CustomRuleSrs` — локально закэшированный `.srs` бинарь по URL + доп-фильтры на routing-rule level (outbound).
  - `CustomRulePreset` — тонкая ссылка `{presetId, varsValues}` на шаблонный пресет. Outbound живёт в `varsValues['outbound']` (поля `outbound` нет — подставляется через `@outbound`).

  Компилятор теперь exhaustive-проверяет pattern-match `switch (cr)` в builder / UI. Общие методы — `withEnabled` / `withName` / `withOutbound` на base-class (type-preserving), плюс convenience-getters (`domains`/`srsUrl`/`presetId`/…) для read-only доступа из кода, не заботящегося о подтипе.
- **`CustomRule.fromJson` dispatch** по `kind` → `CustomRuleInline.fromJson` / `CustomRuleSrs.fromJson` / `CustomRulePreset.fromJson`. Backward-compat: старое поле `target` читается как `outbound` (pre-1.4.1 переименование).
- **Rename `target → outbound` + `kRejectTarget → kOutboundReject`** — везде (модель, builder, UI, Debug API, шаблон). Совпадает с sing-box JSON-schema и UI-лейблом.
- **Preset var `out → outbound`** в шаблоне и `varsValues` — убирает недоразумение между тремя именами одного концепта.

### Added — SRS cache для bundle-пресетов (spec 011 compliance)

До 1.4.1 `CustomRulePreset` с remote rule_set'ом в шаблоне (Block Ads, Russia-only services) пропускал `type: "remote"` прямо в конфиг, и sing-box качал сам при старте — нарушение принципа spec 011 «local-only, ручной download через ☁».

Теперь:
- `RuleSetDownloader.{presetCacheId, cachedPathForPreset, downloadForPreset, deleteForPreset}` — новый namespace ключей `preset__<presetId>__<tag>` для кэша preset-owned .srs файлов.
- `expandPreset` при обнаружении `type: "remote"` в `preset.ruleSets` проверяет cached path — есть → заменяет на `{type: "local", path: "<кэш>"}`, нет → rule_set skip + warning (правило всё равно попадает в конфиг с headless-routing, но match не работает до первого download'а).
- `buildConfig` pre-resolve'ит cache-paths для preset-правил перед вызовом `applyPresetBundles` (ключ `<presetId>|<rule_set_tag>`).
- **UI ☁-кнопка у preset-правил с remote rule_set'ами** — в списке Rules рядом с preset-правилом появляется та же cloud-иконка что у srs. Tap → скачивает все remote rule_set'ы пресета в cache. Long-press → menu Refresh / Clear. Switch auto-download — toggle-on при отсутствующем кэше триггерит скачивание, затем enable. "Cached" = все remote rule_set'ы пресета имеют локальный .srs (если хоть один отсутствует → ☁ иконка download, switch auto-download'ит).

### Fixed — VPN startup / preset-rule corner cases (task 011)

- **`Failed to start service: rule-set not found`** — когда preset имел `type: "remote"` rule_set без кэша, expansion дропал rule_set, но `routing_rule.rule_set: "<tag>"` оставался в `route.rules`, и sing-box падал при парсинге конфига. Добавлен **dangling-rule_set guard** в `expandPreset`: если `routing_rule.rule_set` ссылается на tag, которого нет среди expanded rule-sets (rule_set skip'нулся из-за missing cache) → routing_rule тоже drop'ается + warning.
- **☁-кнопка preset-правила не срабатывала на tap** — в `_presetSrsStatusButton` GestureDetector с `HitTestBehavior.opaque` перехватывал tap ДО `IconButton.onPressed`. Заменён на `InkWell` с `onTap` + `onLongPress` — один виджет ловит оба жеста.
- **Preset с remote rule_set'ами добавляется через «Add to Rules» disabled** — по аналогии с `CustomRuleSrs` (spec §011: без кэша правило не работает, не вводим юзера в заблуждение). Switch OFF + ☁-кнопка download; toggle-on auto-download'ит и включает.
- **Auto-disable preset-правил без кэша на load** — `_refreshSrsCache` теперь при отсутствии локальных `.srs` выставляет `rule.withEnabled(false)` + persist. Ранее `_template` устанавливался **после** `_refreshSrsCache`, из-за чего `_presetFor` возвращал null и auto-disable не срабатывал — исправлено (template set before cache refresh).

### Added — Preset bundles: self-contained parametrized rules (spec 033, task 010)

- **Новый `CustomRuleKind.preset`** — тонкая ссылка `{presetId, varsValues}` на `SelectableRule` в `wizard_template.json`. В отличие от `inline/srs` (data-копия), preset-правило разворачивается из шаблона при каждом build'е → обновление шаблона автоматически меняет поведение всех preset-правил пользователя (никаких миграций данных).
- **Bundle-формат пресета**: self-contained `rule_set` + `dns_rule` + `routing rule` + `dns_servers` с типизированными переменными (`@var`). Пресет несёт собственные DNS-серверы и DNS-правило, которые попадают в конфиг **только когда он активен** — отключил пресет → его `yandex_doh` уходит из `dns.servers`.
- **Типизированные переменные** (в `SelectableRule.vars`): `outbound` (picker outbound-групп), `dns_servers` (picker из `preset.dns_servers[].tag`), плюс существующие `enum`/`text`/`bool`/`number`. Новый флаг `required: bool = true` — для optional переменных в UI появляется пункт "— (default/none)", фрагменты с unresolved `@var` выкидываются целиком при expansion'е.
- **Merge-стратегия bundle-фрагментов** (`lib/services/builder/preset_expand.dart`): identical-skip по tag + first-wins с warning для реальных конфликтов. DNS-rules инжектируются **перед** fallback-правилом template'а, DNS-серверы добавляются после template-baseline. Порядок детерминирован по индексу CustomRule в UI-списке.
- **UI редактора** (`custom_rule_edit_screen.dart`): для `kind: preset` показывается "Based on preset" бэйдж + форма vars + JSON-preview expanded bundle. Match-поля (domain/port/package/ip/protocol) скрыты — содержимое пресета правится только через шаблон. Broken preset (presetId не найден в шаблоне) → error-card с Delete.
- **Russian domains direct** переведён на bundle-формат. Три типизированные переменные:
  - `out` — OutboundPicker, дефолт `direct-out`.
  - `dns_server` — dropdown `yandex_doh`/`yandex_dot`/`yandex_udp`, `required: false`, дефолт `yandex_doh`.
  - `dns_ip` — enum из 10 IP (Safe/Base/Family, IPv4+IPv6 primary+alt) с human-readable `title`; применяется только к UDP.

  Три DNS-сервера в bundle: `yandex_doh` и `yandex_dot` хардкодят `server: "77.88.8.88"` + `tls.server_name: "safe.dot.dns.yandex.net"` (Safe-режим Yandex, bootstrap не нужен — IP напрямую); `yandex_udp` берёт IP из `@dns_ip`. Список TLD: `.ru/.su/.рф/.рус/.москва/.moscow/.tatar/.дети/.онлайн/.сайт/.орг/.ком`.
- **`WizardOption`** — `options` у `WizardVar` расширен с `List<String>` до `List<WizardOption>` с полями `{title, value}`. Legacy-совместимо: строка `"foo"` парсится как `{title: "foo", value: "foo"}`. UI показывает `title`, в `varsValues` / substitution идёт `value`. Нужно для human-readable меток в dropdown'ах пресетных правил (например, `"77.88.8.88 · Safe" → 77.88.8.88`).
- **Broken preset recovery** — если в будущей версии `presetId` удалён/переименован, в UI появляется broken-card "Preset not found" с кнопкой Delete; при сборке правило пропускается + warning в `emitWarnings`.

### Changed — Russian & Cyrillic TLDs expanded
- Wizard template: DNS rule (Yandex DoH) и `ru-domains` rule-set расширены с 4 до 12 суффиксов — добавлены `xn--p1acf` (.рус), `xn--80adxhks` (.москва), `moscow`, `tatar`, `xn--d1acj3b` (.дети), `xn--80aswg` (.сайт), `xn--c1avg` (.орг), `xn--j1aef` (.ком). Пресет «Russian domains direct» теперь описан как "Route Russian & Cyrillic TLDs directly."

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-21

Major release: unified routing rules, local-only SRS, Stats tabs + Top apps, Debug API, VPN reliability overhaul, per-server detour toggles, perf pass, Flutter correctness fixes. Полные заметки — `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, детальные отчёты задач — `docs/spec/tasks/001..009`.

### Added — Unified routing rules model (spec 030)

- **`CustomRule` заменяет 3 параллельных механизма**: `AppRule` (per-package), `SelectableRule` (template пресеты), `CustomRule v1.3.x` (per-rule matcher). Теперь одна модель с полями domain/IP/port/package/protocol/private-IP/srs в одной форме.
- **Один редактор** с табами `Params` / `View`. Params сгруппирован APPS → Source (inline/srs) → MATCH / RULE-SET URL → PORT → PROTOCOL → Delete. Dirty-aware save, unsaved back → «Discard changes?».
- **Reorder** через drag-handle, long-press → Delete с подтверждением.
- **JSON preview** (вкладка View) показывает готовый sing-box фрагмент конфига (rule_set + routing rule) + warnings.
- **Presets → каталог**: вкладка Presets стала read-only каталогом, кнопка «Copy to Rules» клонирует пресет в твой реестр.
- **Миграции one-shot**:
  - `AppRule → CustomRule.packages` (`SettingsStorage._absorbLegacyAppRules` при первом `getCustomRules`).
  - `enabled_rules + rule_outbounds → CustomRule` (`RoutingScreen._migrateLegacyPresets` при первой load'е, флаг `presets_migrated`).
  - Fresh installs получают seed из `template.selectableRules.where(r => r.defaultEnabled)`.
- **`AppRule` и `applyAppRules` удалены** — функциональность через `CustomRule.packages`.

### Added — SRS local-only (spec 011)

- Sing-box больше ничего не качает сам. Ручной download через ☁ в UI, никаких скрытых auto-update / TTL-refetch.
- **Cloud icon states**: ☁ (not cached) / ✅ (cached, green) / ❌ (failed) / spinner. Tap = download/retry.
- **Enable gate** — switch правила disabled пока нет cached файла.
- **Long-press на ☁ в editor** → menu: Refresh SRS / Clear cached file.
- **Cleanup** — Delete rule удаляет cached файл, URL change на save стирает старый кэш.
- `RuleSetDownloader` переписан: id-based API (вместо tag), удалены `maxAge` / `cacheAll` (auto-refresh убран).

### Added — Debug API (spec 031)

- **Локальный HTTP-сервер** для dev-introspection/control (`localhost:9269`). Runtime-toggle в App Settings → Developer (default OFF).
- **Endpoints** (read): `/state`, `/device`, `/clash/*` (proxy с auto-auth), `/logs`, `/config`, `/files/*`, `/ping`.
- **Action endpoints** (triggers): `/action/ping-all`, `/action/ping-node`, `/action/run-urltest`, `/action/switch-node`, `/action/set-group`, `/action/start-vpn`, `/action/stop-vpn`, `/action/rebuild-config`, `/action/refresh-subs`, `/action/download-srs`, `/action/clear-srs`, `/action/toast`.
- **CRUD endpoints** (домнетные мутации): `/rules` (POST/PATCH/DELETE + reorder), `/subs` (POST/PATCH/DELETE + refresh), `/settings` (scoped writes), `/config` override.
- **Middleware pipeline**: `errorMapper → accessLog → hostCheck (127.0.0.1 only) → auth (Bearer token) → timeout → router`. Token генерится на первое включение, хранится в SettingsStorage, показывается с кнопкой Copy (единственный канал передачи).
- **Bind строго на 127.0.0.1** — сеть не достанет, adb-forward обязателен.

### Added — Stats redesign

- **Statistics-экран с табами** `Overview` / `Connections` — больше не нужен отдельный navigate.
- **Карточка Top apps** с иконкой + display name + packageName + byte counters.
- **Карточка By routing rule**.
- **Чип sing-box memory**.
- Refresh каждые 3с, pause в background (см. Performance).

### Added — Template vars UX

- Формы в Settings / Routing перерисованы: label сверху, описание во всю ширину, поле — тоже.
- **`Test URL` / `Test interval` / `Tolerance (ms)`** получили preset-дропдауны с пресетами.
- **URLTest interval default поднят с `1m` до `5m`** под invariant spam-avoidance.
- **Nested sections** в `wizard_template.json` — `sections[].vars[]` с chapter (core/routing/dns). Новые chapter'ы — без правок в Dart.
- **`options` на `type: text`** — combo-dropdown: свободный ввод + suffix-▾ popup с пресетами.

### Added — Auto-update subscriptions toggle

- **Глобальный выключатель** в App Settings → Subscriptions (+ дубль в `SubscriptionsScreen` PopupMenu). Default ON.
- Off → автоматические триггеры (appStart / vpnConnected / periodic / vpnStopped) скипаются; ручное ⟳ работает всегда.
- См. spec 027 §Global toggle.

### Added — Background / Battery UX (spec 022)

- **App Settings → Battery optimization whitelist status** — показывает whitelist-ли наш app.
- **App info (OEM toggles)** с hint-диалогом — направляет на per-app settings страницу, где OEM-специфичные «Autostart», «Background activity», «Battery saver» toggle'ы.
- **Auto-ping after connect** — через 5с после connected пингуем ноды активной группы (default ON, toggle в App Settings).

### Added — Keep-on-exit status sync

- Фикс: при `Keep VPN on exit = true` + swipe из recents + возврат в app UI застревал в Disconnected хотя туннель активен.
- Реализация: `BoxVpnService.Companion.currentStatus: VpnStatus` — `@Volatile` mirror; MethodChannel `getVpnStatus`; `HomeController.init()` pull'ит статус сразу после подписки.

### Added — Clash API reference docs

- Новый `docs/api/clash-api-reference.md` — полный разбор sing-box 1.12.12 Clash API: структура `/proxies`, поля `connections[].metadata` (включая `processPath` с uid-суффиксом, `dnsMode`, `rule`+`rulePayload`, chains ordering), `/group/<tag>/delay` с pitfall'ом "force-urltest не обновляет `.now` персистентно", `/traffic` streaming vs snapshot.

### Added — Per-server detour toggles (UserServer)

- Две новые галки в Node Settings (появляются когда `⚙ ` префикс ON): **Register in VPN groups**, **Register in auto group**. Default обе OFF.
- Detour-сервер по умолчанию скрыт в selector и ✨auto, остаётся доступен только как звено цепочки. Override через явные галки.
- Используется существующий `UserServer.detourPolicy` — никаких новых моделей. Builder детектит `kDetourTagPrefix` в `main.tag`.
- Scope: только UserServer (1 server = 1 node). См. `docs/spec/tasks/006`.

### Added — Revoke UX

- **SnackBar «VPN taken by another app»** с action Start (5 сек) когда другое VPN захватывает туннель. Раньше — пугающая красная пилюля «Revoked by another VPN».
- Chip показывает нейтральный Disconnected. Internal `state.tunnel == revoked` сохраняется для side-effect detection.
- **Unified cleanup**: heartbeat-driven `_onTunnelDead` теперь сбрасывает те же поля что broadcast-driven `_handleStatusEvent` (`_clash=null`, `traffic=zero`, `connectedSince=null`, `configStaleSinceStart=false`).
- См. `docs/spec/tasks/003`.

### Added — Lifecycle resume re-sync

- На `AppLifecycleState.resumed` — one-shot pull `getVpnStatus()` с сравнением; при divergence прогон raw через `_handleStatusEvent`. Покрывает случаи Doze/OOM-kill service в background без broadcast'а.
- Никакого polling'а — event-driven. См. `docs/spec/tasks/004`.

### Added — Reload button (right of status chip)

- **Short tap** — smart default: `Connect` (VPN off) / `Reconnect` (on, clean) / `Rebuild config + reconnect` (on, dirty).
- **Long-press** — меню из 3 действий: `Reconnect`, `Rebuild config only`, `Rebuild config + reconnect`.
- Dirty-подсветка (primary-container фон).
- **Fix**: Flutter `Tooltip` на Android использовал long-press как свой trigger — перехватывал `InkWell.onLongPress`. Tooltip → `Semantics(label: ...)` (accessibility сохранена).

### Added — Blocking `stopVPN` + intent-based reset

- **`BoxVpnService.stopAwait`** возвращает `Deferred<Unit>`, completes в `setStatus(Stopped)`. `VpnPlugin.stopVPN` handler на `pluginScope.launch` + `withTimeout(5s).await`.
- **`_stopInternal` / `_startInternal`** — single-intent примитивы с intent-based reset `configStaleSinceStart=false`. `reconnect()` = композиция обоих, без Dart-side координации.
- См. `docs/spec/tasks/002`.

### Added — Diagnostic logging pipeline

- Полный `[vpn]` prefix logging для VPN lifecycle: `onStartCommand`, `doStop`, `setStatus`, `receiver.onReceive`, `statusReceiver.onReceive` с `sink` флагом, Dart `_handleStatusEvent` / `reconnect` / `saveParsedConfig`.
- `StackTrace.current` в `saveParsedConfig` в `kDebugMode` guard.

### Fixed — VPN reconnect reliability

- **Root cause: sink leak** в `BoxVpnClient.onStatusChanged`. Каждое обращение к getter'у создавало новый `receiveBroadcastStream()` → новый `onListen` на native → перезаписывал shared `statusSink`; следующий `onCancel` обнулял его. Основной `_statusSub` в HomeController становился зомби, все последующие transition events терялись. Фикс — `late final _statusStream` + `asBroadcastStream()`. Заодно починило потерю heartbeat/traffic updates и ревоке-detection после первого reconnect'а. См. `docs/spec/tasks/001`.
- **`TunnelStatus.unknown`** — default для неизвестного raw вместо `disconnected`. Убирает ложные срабатывания `firstWhere(disconnected|revoked)` predicate'ов на мусорных events. UI маппит unknown → Disconnected label.

### Fixed — прочие критичные

- **`ip_is_private` unknown field** — sing-box отклонял конфиг с `ip_is_private` в headless rule. Поле не поддерживается в rule_set inline, работает только на routing-rule level. Перенесено, где per sing-box formula становится OR с `rule_set`.
- **Protocol-only rules skip'ались** — когда в rule только `protocol: [bittorrent]` (без domain/ip_cidr), `match` был пустой → skip. Теперь эмитится routing rule без rule_set, всё работает.
- **AppPicker crashed при parallel tap** — `setState` без `mounted` guard'а + double `Navigator.pop`.

### Fixed — Flutter correctness (P0 code-review fixes)

По результатам глубокого code review (`docs/spec/tasks/008` §A) закрыты три анти-паттерна Flutter в `home_screen.dart`. Это корректность, не оптимизации — затрагивают устойчивость анимации, таймеров и dispose-контракта. Fix в коммите `2593152`, отчёт — `docs/spec/tasks/009`.

- **Side-effects в `build` убраны.** Управление `_connectingAnim.repeat/stop/reset` жило в `_buildStatusChip` (вызывается из `AnimatedBuilder` — т.е. в build-фазе). Hot path из heartbeat (каждые 20с) и mass ping (десятки emit/sec) дёргал контроллер анимации лишний раз. Перенесено в listener `_onControllerChange`, триггерится только при реальной смене tunnel state.
- **`Timer` не создаётся из build.** Auto-dismiss таймер для `lastError` жил в `Builder` внутри build (`if (_errorTimerFor != state.lastError) { cancel + new Timer }`) — хрупко при агрессивных rebuild'ах. Перенесён в тот же listener с явным transition detection через `_prevError`.
- **`HomeScreen.dispose()` теперь полный.** Добавлены `_controller.dispose()` (отменяет `_statusSub`, heartbeat, transient timer), `_subController.dispose()`, `_connectingAnim.dispose()`. Раньше пропускались — production ОС убивала процесс, но hot reload / тесты / смена root widget'а давали бы утечку.

### Performance

- **ConfigCache** в `HomeState`: парсинг outbound JSON (`detourTags` + `protoByTag`) делается один раз при `saveParsedConfig`, не на каждый rebuild ListView. С 50+ нодами и сортировкой по ping — убирает заметный jank в node list hot-path'е.
- **`sortedNodes` memoize** через `late final` — один sort на HomeState instance, не на каждый getter access.
- **Batched `_emit`** в `_handleStatusEvent` — 2-3 последовательных notifyListeners на один status event схлопнуты в один.
- **Single safety-timer** для transient-фазы (Starting/Stopping): переиспользуемый `Timer?` вместо плодящихся `Future.delayed` на каждое transient event.
- **Background-paused timers** в Stats/Connections screens (`WidgetsBindingObserver`): polling Clash API останавливается когда app в background; возобновляется на resume. Экономит battery + method-channel round-trips.
- **Lint cleanup**: unused `dart:typed_data` import, `?proto` null-aware marker, docstring escapes.

См. `docs/spec/tasks/005`.

### Changed — Build: Android 11+ primary, 8.0+ best-effort

- `minSdk = 26` (Android 8.0) в `app/android/app/build.gradle.kts`. Tiered support:
  - **Primary (11+, API 30+)** — тестируется, все фичи, production-ready.
  - **Best-effort (8.0–10, API 26–29)** — compile/install OK, фичи требующие API 30+ деградируют к no-op через runtime SDK_INT check.
  - **Unsupported (<8, API <26)** — install blocked.
- Раньше было `minSdk = flutter.minSdkVersion` = 24 по default'у (факт), в release notes декларировалось 8.0+ (доки). Теперь код соответствует реальному тестированию.

### Changed — прочее

- **`auto-proxy-out` → `✨auto`** — переименование urltest-группы, единая константа `kAutoOutboundTag`. `Icons.speed` в UI.
- **AppPicker lazy icons** — `getInstalledApps` возвращает только metadata (pkg/name/isSystem) за сотни мс, иконки lazy per-tile через `getAppIcon(pkg)` с session-cache. Раньше 500 apps × PNG-compress + base64 = ~10s блокировка UI.
- **Local build speed** — `./scripts/build-local-apk.sh` с `--target-platform android-arm64`: 38 мин → ~1.5 мин. CI продолжает собирать все три (arm + arm64 + x64).
- **Subscription User-Agent** — `LxBox Android subscription client`.

### Refactored

- **Template**: flat `vars: [маркеры + var'ы]` → nested `sections: [{name, chapter, description, vars: [...]}]`. Парсер больше не держит state-переменную «текущая секция». `chapter` на каждой секции (`core` / `routing` / `dns`) позволяет добавлять новые chapter'ы без Dart-правок.
- **Public test servers** manifest вынесен в remote repo — не жжёт bundle.
- `applySelectableRules` удалён — пресеты копируются явно через `selectableRuleToCustom`.
- `AppPickerScreen` — убран editable title (не нужен внутри `CustomRuleEditScreen`).
- `IP Filters` → `Rules` (tab rename).

### Process

- Новая папка **`docs/spec/tasks/`** — журнал выполненных задач с развёрнутыми отчётами (проблема → диагностика → решение → риски → верификация → follow-up). 8 задач в 1.4.0 (001–008). README с форматом.
- **Peer review** получен от внешнего агента ([007](docs/spec/tasks/007-peer-review-tasks-001-006.md)) — отловлен критичный bug в task 006 (`persistSources()` не вызывался после per-node toggle'ов — настройки терялись после рестарта app'а). Закрыто в `e0e7213`.
- **Deep code review** ([008](docs/spec/tasks/008-deep-code-review-perf-refactor.md)) — независимая оценка состояния кода после 001-007, кандидаты на будущий рефакторинг.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed — `UserServer.fromJson` теряла `nodes`
- `toJson` хранит только `rawBody`, но `fromJson` не парсил его обратно — после рестарта app узлы UserServer пропадали → `NodeSettingsScreen._load()` видел пустой `nodes` → бесконечный спиннер.
- Теперь `fromJson` зовёт `parseAll(decode(rawBody))` для восстановления nodes. `rawBody` остаётся источником истины, nodes — derivable.

### Fixed — Detour dropdown в Node Settings не сохранялся
- Раньше писал `detour` в JSON ноды через `_jsonCtrl`, но `parseSingboxEntry` это поле не восстанавливает → save → reparse → detour терялся.
- Теперь сохраняется в `entry.detourPolicy.overrideDetour` (которое builder уже умеет применять). `persistSources()` сразу при выборе в dropdown'е, без отдельного Save.

### Fixed — XHTTP warning перекрывался TLS-insecure
- `node.warnings.first` бралось безусловно, и `InsecureTlsWarning` (parse-time) затмевал `UnsupportedTransportWarning('xhttp')` (emit-time).
- Теперь `_NodeWarningRow` сортирует по severity (error → warning → info), показывает первый по приоритету. XHTTP-fallback отображается оранжевым, TLS-insecure — серым (info severity).
- TLS-insecure понижен до `info`: провайдеры часто намеренно ставят флаг (REALITY, IP-литералы, self-signed). Banner вверху detail-экрана теперь считает только actionable warning'и.

### Added — Auto-regenerate config после `addFromInput`
- Раньше после paste/QR/file подписки/нода — нужно было вручную нажать ⟳ для применения. Теперь после успешного `addFromInput` автоматом `generateConfig` + `saveParsedConfig` + snackbar `Config regenerated: N nodes`.

### Added — Empty `+` button = paste from clipboard
- Если поле ввода пустое и пользователь жмёт `+` — открывается поток `paste-from-clipboard` (анализ типа + диалог подтверждения). Без поля — экономит шаг.

### Added — Editable Tag field в `NodeSettingsScreen`
- Отдельное поле `Tag` под секцией `Server` (раньше тег был зашит в JSON-редакторе и неудобно правился).
- AppBar title обновляется live при редактировании.
- На save идёт в `tag` outbound JSON-а.

### Added — "Mark as detour server" switch
- Toggle в `NodeSettingsScreen` — добавляет/убирает префикс `⚙ ` к tag'у. Префикс хранится в самом tag'е (никаких отдельных флагов в JSON), визуально отделяет detour-серверы в списках и в Override-detour picker'е.

### Added — Long-press → "Copy URI"
- Ранее long-press по ноде на главном давал только `Copy server (JSON)`. Теперь есть `Copy URI` — оригинальный `vless://` / `wireguard://` / etc через `node.toUri()` (round-trip parser v2). Для control-узлов (`direct-out`, `auto-proxy-out`) показывает snackbar "No source URI for this node".
- `Copy server` переименован в `Copy server (JSON)` для ясности.

### Added — Subtitle на главном: `[ACTIVE] [PROTOCOL]   [50MS →]`
- ACTIVE — зелёный pill (вместо текстовой "ACTIVE · 50MS"), протокол слева серым, ping справа цветом по latency.
- Протокол берётся из outbound JSON: `VLESS`, `Hy2`, `WG`, `TUIC`, `SS` etc. TLS-суффикс убран — у большинства протоколов TLS дефолт, метить каждый = шум.
- Для `auto-proxy-out` (urltest) показывает proto **выбранной** ноды: `→ BL: Frankfurt   VLESS`.

### Changed — `UserServers` → `UserServer` (rename)
- Названо во множественном числе исторически, но всегда ровно один node (paste/QR/file/manual). Sealed-класс переименован в singular для ясности. JSON discriminator `'type': 'user'` сохранён — миграции не нужны.
- 10 файлов затронуто (1 модель, 2 контроллера, 4 экрана, 4 теста, миграция).

### Changed — Subtitle для UserServer: `WIREGUARD server` / `VLESS server`
- Раньше: разные строки в зависимости от формы импорта (`WireGuard config` / `Direct link` / `JSON outbound`) — описывало форму копипасты, не суть. После рестарта (когда `entry.status` теряется) показывало "1 node" — бессмысленно для single-node entries.
- Теперь единообразно: `<PROTOCOL> server` для любых UserServer независимо от формы добавления.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Subscription auto-update (spec 027)
- **4 триггера** автообновления подписок: app start, через 2 мин после VPN connected, periodic 1 час, сразу по VPN disconnected. Manual refresh (⟳) — пятый, force.
- **Жёсткие gates** против спама: `minRetryInterval=15min` (per-subscription, переживает рестарт через persisted `lastUpdateAttempt`), `maxFailsPerSession=5` (in-memory, размораживается при рестарте app), `perSubscriptionDelay=10s ± 2s jitter` между подписками внутри прохода, `_running`/`_inFlight` dedup-флаги, `lastUpdateStatus==inProgress` guard защищает от двойных кликов.
- **Crash-safe init sweep**: при старте app залипший `inProgress` (после `kill -9`) сбрасывается в `failed`, fetch возможен после 15-min cooldown.
- **Persisted state** в `server_lists.json`: `lastUpdated`, `lastUpdateAttempt`, `lastUpdateStatus` (`never`/`ok`/`failed`/`inProgress`), `consecutiveFails`.
- **UI в строках подписок** (Servers): `124 nodes · 🔄 24h · 🕐 3h ago · (2 fails)` — interval, время с последнего успеха, счётчик подряд-фейлов (красным).
- **Subscription block в detail screen** (Settings tab): URL (tap=copy), Update interval (picker `[1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 168]h`), Status row с иконкой + last success/attempt/node count, Refresh now кнопка.
- Manual refresh "Update all" → роутинг через `AutoUpdater.maybeUpdateAll(manual, force:true)` с `resetAllFailCounts()`. Per-entry ⟳ → прямой `_fetchEntryByRef` + `resetFailCount(url)` (размораживает подписку из session-cap).
- **Rebuild config (⟳ на Home) НЕ триггерит HTTP** — только локальная сборка из уже-загруженных nodes.

### Added — Restart warning sticky flag (spec 003 §8a)
- Розовая плашка **«Config changed — restart VPN to apply»** под кнопкой Stop теперь показывается надёжно при любом сценарии: routing Apply, settings change, debug import, manual rebuild. Раньше пропадала при отмене Stop-диалога.
- Реализация: derived getter `_needsRestart` поверх sticky-флага `state.configStaleSinceStart` в `HomeState`. Флаг ставится в `saveParsedConfig` при `tunnelUp`, сбрасывается **только** на реальном tunnel transition (connected ↔ disconnected/revoked).

### Added — AntiDPI: Mixed-case SNI (spec 028)
- Toggle **Mixed-case SNI** в Settings → DPI Bypass. Рандомизирует регистр букв в `server_name` (`WwW.gOoGle.CoM`). По RFC 6066 SNI case-insensitive — сервер обязан принять любой регистр; ломает наивный exact-match DPI у региональных провайдеров и корпоративных firewall'ов.
- First-hop only (консистентно с TLS Fragment), per-outbound независимая рандомизация. Punycode-метки (`xn--…`) не трогаем (сохраняем DNS-валидность).
- Help-текст честный: «Bypasses simple exact-match DPI; ineffective against GFW-class filtering». Default off.
- 10 unit-тестов: RFC compliance, IP-литералы, punycode, detour skip, independent randomization.

### Added — Haptic feedback on VPN events (spec 029)
- Toggle **Haptic feedback** в App Settings → Feedback (default **on**). Уважает системную настройку Android Touch feedback.
- Маппинг событий: tap Start/Stop → лёгкий tick; VPN connected → средний impact; user disconnect → лёгкий impact; revoked / heartbeat fail → тяжёлый impact (heartbeat-fail только **первый раз**, не на каждый tick); manual subscription fetch success → лёгкий, fail → средний.
- Auto/periodic события (subscription auto-update, ping, scroll) — **не** триггерят haptic.
- Throttle 100мс между импульсами защищает от спама.

### Added — Subscription title fallback via `Content-Disposition`
- Если у подписки нет `profile-title` header, имя берётся из `Content-Disposition: filename=...`. Поддержка quoted/unquoted filename и RFC 5987 `filename*=UTF-8''<percent-encoded>`. Стрипает `.txt`/`.yaml`/`.yml`/`.json`/`.conf` расширения.

### Changed — Subscription User-Agent
- HTTP к подпискам теперь идёт с UA `LxBox Android subscription client` (был `SubscriptionParserClient`). Если провайдер начнёт отдавать default response без `subscription-userinfo` headers — откатывайте.

### Changed — DNS rules: inline `.ru` domain_suffix
- DNS правило для Yandex DoH теперь содержит `domain_suffix: [ru, xn--p1ai, su]` напрямую, вместо `rule_set: ru-domains` reference. Поведение идентичное; читается прозрачнее в DNS settings UI.
- `route.rule_set.ru-domains` остаётся (используется selectable rule "Russian domains direct").

### Added — Local build marker
- Скрипт `scripts/build-local-apk.sh` собирает APK с `--dart-define`'ами `BUILD_LOCAL=true`, `BUILD_GIT_DESC`, `BUILD_LAST_TAG`, `BUILD_COMMITS_SINCE_TAG`, `BUILD_TIME`.
- В About screen появляется розовая плашка «🧪 LOCAL BUILD · 7 commits since v1.2.0» с git describe и временем сборки. CI builds (через `flutter build` напрямую) не помечаются.

### Added / Removed — Parser v2 (internal rewrite, спека 026, все 5 фаз)
- Типизированная sealed-иерархия `NodeSpec` (9 протоколов: VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, Hysteria2, **TUIC v5 (новый)**, SSH, SOCKS, WireGuard).
- Полиморфный `emit(vars)`: WireGuard → Endpoint, остальные → Outbound, без рантайм-проверок типа.
- Round-trip `parseUri(spec.toUri()) ≈ spec` с тестами для каждого варианта.
- XHTTP fallback через sealed `TransportSpec` — компилятор не даёт забыть.
- `ServerList` (sealed: `SubscriptionServers` / `UserServers`) — заменяет плоский `ProxySource`. Одноразовая миграция `proxy_sources` → `server_lists` при первом чтении `SettingsStorage`.
- Функциональный pipeline: `parseFromSource(SubscriptionSource) → ServerRegistry → buildConfig(...) → BuildResult(config, ValidationResult, warnings)`.
- `ValidationResult` с типизированными `ValidationIssue`: dangling outbound refs, empty urltest, invalid selector default.
- **Удалено**: `lib/services/node_parser.dart` (~1100 LOC), `config_builder.dart` (~550), `source_loader.dart`, `subscription_fetcher.dart`, `subscription_decoder.dart`, `xray_json_parser.dart`, `models/parsed_node.dart`, `models/proxy_source.dart`. `SubscriptionController` и `SettingsStorage` переведены на v2.
- 103 теста в v2-юните (models, parser, round-trip, builder, validator, migration, subscription pipeline, e2e). Debug + release APK собираются.

### Added — TLS Fragment (DPI bypass)
- **TLS Fragment**: фрагментация TLS ClientHello для обхода DPI. Record fragment support.
- Настраивается в VPN Settings.

### Added — WireGuard Endpoint Support
- **WireGuard endpoint**: поддержка WireGuard endpoint в подписках (не outbound).
- **WireGuard INI auto-detection**: автоматическое определение INI-формата WireGuard конфигов при импорте.

### Added — JSON Outbound Import
- **Paste dialog**: вставка JSON outbound через диалог (Smart Paste). Автоопределение формата.

### Added — Node Settings Screen
- **Node Settings**: экран с JSON-редактором outbound'а и dropdown для выбора detour.

### Added — Per-Subscription Settings
- **Register / Use / Override**: настройки detour-серверов на уровне подписки.
- Register — зарегистрировать detour-серверы из подписки.
- Use — использовать detour-серверы для нод этой подписки.
- Override — принудительно назначить detour для всех нод подписки.

### Added — Detour Server Naming
- **⚙ prefix**: detour-серверы отображаются с префиксом ⚙ вместо `_jump_server`.

### Added — Tune Button
- **Tune button**: кнопка для управления видимостью detour-серверов в списке нод.

### Changed — UX (since v1.1.1)
- **Servers**: «Subscriptions» переименовано в «Servers».
- **Speed test**: 10 серверов, upload через PUT.
- **Connections screen**: отображение process/app name.
- **Animated VPN status chip**: анимированный индикатор статуса VPN.
- **Copy menu**: server/detour/both; detour убран из копирования по умолчанию.
- **Settings with sections**: настройки разбиты на секции.
- **Compact + button**: компактная кнопка добавления, smart paste dialog.
- **Ping timeout**: увеличен до 10 секунд.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-18

### Changed — Outbound groups overhaul
- Переименование: **proxy-out → vpn-1**, добавлен **vpn-3** (VPN ①/②/③).
- **VPN ①** всегда генерируется, галочка заблокирована.
- **auto-proxy-out** теперь управляется галочкой **Include Auto**: при включении генерируется как urltest и добавляется в `vpn-*`; при выключении секция не создаётся вовсе.

### Changed — Node list UX
- **direct-out** и **auto-proxy-out** всегда вверху списка (в любом режиме сортировки, сначала direct, потом auto), с лёгкой подсветкой.
- Контекстное меню (long-press):
  - Copy-действия скрыты для `direct-out` / `auto-proxy-out`.
  - *Copy detour* и *Copy server + detour* скрыты, если у ноды нет detour.

### Changed — Defaults
- `urltest_tolerance` по умолчанию 30 ms (было 100).

---

## [1.1.1] — Previous release

### Added — Native VPN Service (Feature 013)
- **Удалён плагин `flutter_singbox_vpn`**: вся нативная логика перенесена напрямую в `android/app/`.
- Новый пакет `com.leadaxe.lxbox.vpn`: VpnPlugin, BoxVpnService, ConfigManager, ServiceNotification, PlatformInterfaceWrapper, DefaultNetworkMonitor/Listener.
- **Конфиг в файле**: хранение в `files/singbox_config.json` вместо SharedPreferences.
- **BoxVpnClient** Dart-обёртка с MethodChannel/EventChannel — идентичный API.
- Убраны неиспользуемые компоненты: TileService, BootReceiver, ProxyService, per-app tunneling, traffic EventChannel.

### Added — Subscription Detail View (Feature 014)
- **Тап по подписке** → полноэкранный detail screen с метаинформацией (URL, дата обновления, кол-во нод).
- **Список нод**: загружается при открытии через SourceLoader, отображается с иконками протоколов.
- **Inline rename**: кнопка Edit в AppBar → TextField для переименования.
- **Delete с подтверждением**: кнопка Delete → confirm dialog → удаление + pop.
- **Refresh**: кнопка обновления нод прямо из detail screen.
- Убраны: swipe-to-delete и long press bottom sheet на основном списке.

### Added — Rule Outbound Selection (Feature 015)
- **Дропдаун outbound** рядом с каждым routing rule (direct/proxy/auto/vpn-1/vpn-2).
- Варианты динамически зависят от включённых proxy groups.
- Action-based правила (Block Ads) — без дропдауна.
- **Route final**: настройка fallback outbound для неизвестного трафика.
- Backend уже был реализован ранее (SettingsStorage + ConfigBuilder).

### Added — Routing Screen (Feature 016)
- **Отдельный экран Routing**: Proxy Groups + Routing Rules + outbound dropdowns + route.final.
- **Settings упрощён**: остались только технические переменные (log level, Clash API, DNS и т.д.).
- Routing добавлен в drawer навигации.
- Long-press на заголовке Nodes теперь ведёт на Routing вместо Settings.

### Added — App Routing Rules (Feature 017)
- **App Rules**: именованные группы приложений с выбором outbound (direct/proxy/vpn-X).
- Каждое правило генерирует sing-box routing rule с `package_name`.
- **AppPickerScreen**: выбор приложений с иконками, поиск, select all, invert, clipboard import/export, show/hide system apps.
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission для полного списка приложений на Android 11+.

### Added — App Settings
- **Отдельный экран App Settings**: выбор темы (Light / Dark / System).
- ThemeNotifier с персистентностью через SharedPreferences.
- Drawer: разделены "VPN Settings" (config vars) и "App Settings" (тема).

### Changed — UX Improvements
- **Start/Stop** — одна toggle кнопка вместо двух (зелёный Start / красный Stop).
- **Get Free VPN** перенесён из главного экрана в Subscriptions (empty state).
- **Mass Ping** — 20 параллельных пингов (было последовательно), сброс результатов при старте.
- **Clash API**: рандомный порт (49152-65535) вместо 9090, секрет автогенерируется если пустой.
- **Secret поля**: кнопка-глаз для toggle видимости.
- **Portrait lock**: экран не поворачивается.
- **Diagnostic snackbar**: показывает причину ошибки при неудачном Start.
- **Empty config guard**: кнопка Start disabled если нет конфига.

### Fixed
- Outbound tag desync: `_makeUnique` менял `node.tag` но не `outbound['tag']` → дубли тегов при одинаковых именах нод.
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission для DefaultNetworkMonitor.
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` для полного списка приложений.
- libbox 1.12.12 API: `LocalResolver` с `ExchangeContext`, `writeLog` override.
- `serviceScope` вместо `GlobalScope` — structured concurrency, нет orphaned coroutines.
- `startForeground` перед `stopSelf` в error paths.
- TextEditingController leak в Settings (создавался в build без dispose).

### Added — Connections Screen
- **Тап на traffic bar** → живой список активных соединений (destination, chain, network, duration, traffic).
- Закрытие отдельного соединения или всех.
- Автообновление каждые 2 секунды.

### Added — Ping Settings
- **Long press на кнопку пинга** → bottom sheet: test URL, timeout (ms).
- Настройки передаются в Clash API delay.

### Added — Config Editor Improvements
- Popup menu (3 точки): Paste from clipboard, Load from file, Copy, Share.
- Drawer упрощён: Config Editor — один пункт вместо expansion tile.

### Added — Subscription Metadata Display
- **Traffic bar** в detail screen: upload/download/total (progress bar + текст).
- **Expire date**: "N days left" или "Expired".
- **Support chip**: иконка телеграма для t.me, help для остальных. Tap → copy URL.
- **Web page chip**: ссылка на страницу подписки.
- **Support icon** в списке подписок рядом с node count.

### Changed — UX
- **Sort icons**: уникальная иконка для каждого режима (Ping↑, Ping↓, A→Z, Z→A, Default).
- **Z→A сортировка** добавлена.
- **Stop button**: одинаковый стиль с Start (без красного).
- **Rebuild config button** на главном экране.
- **URLTest** убран из dropdown групп, показывает `→ auto-selected` в subtitle.
- **Routing rules layout**: title + dropdown на одной строке, subtitle full width.
- **SRS indicator**: иконка облака для правил с remote rule sets.
- **App Groups**: переименовано из App Rules, название редактируется в picker'е.
- **App picker**: мгновенное открытие с прелоадером (addPostFrameCallback).

### Fixed — VPN Revoke Handling
- **onRevoke** шлёт Stopped + error мгновенно (не через doStop).
- **doStop** разрешён из любого состояния (было только Started).
- **10с таймаут**: если зависли на Stopping/Connecting — принудительный disconnect.

### Fixed — Wizard template TUN inbound
- **`inbounds` больше не пустой**: обязательный `tun` inbound (`tag: tun-in`), `auto_route`, MTU, `stack`.
- **Совместимость с рабочими libbox-конфигами**: `address` — одна строка CIDR (не массив), по умолчанию `172.16.0.1/30`; MTU **1492**; `strict_route` по умолчанию **false** (true часто ломает трафик на Android).
- **DNS**: сервер `cloudflare_udp` (1.1.1.1:53), `route.default_domain_resolver` по умолчанию `cloudflare_udp`.
- **Маршрутизация**: перед `hijack-dns` добавлены `resolve` и `sniff` для `inbound: tun-in` (как в конфигах, собранных лаунчером).
- Переменные: `tun_address`, `tun_mtu`, `tun_auto_route`, `tun_strict_route`, `tun_stack`.

### Added — Xray JSON Array + Chained Proxy (Feature 012)
- **XrayJsonParser**: парсинг подписок в формате JSON-массив полных Xray/v2ray конфигов (protocol/vnext/streamSettings → sing-box outbound). Автоматическое определение формата.
- **Chained proxy (Jump)**: поддержка `dialerProxy` / `sockopt.dialer` — SOCKS/VLESS jump-серверы. Генерация отдельного jump outbound + `detour` в основном outbound.
- **ParsedJump** модель + поле `jump` в ParsedNode.
- Reality TLS, transport (ws/grpc/http), tag slug из `remarks` с emoji-флагами.

### Added — Subscription & Config Pipeline
- **Subscription Parser** (Feature 004): полный порт парсера подписок из singbox-launcher (Go → Dart). Поддержка форматов: Base64 (standard, URL-safe, padded/unpadded), Xray JSON array, plain text. Протоколы: VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, Hysteria2, SSH, SOCKS, WireGuard.
- **Config Generator** (Feature 005): wizard template + user vars + parsed nodes → sing-box JSON. 3-pass outbound generation: node outbounds, selector/urltest groups с regex-фильтрами, selectable routing rules.
- **Wizard Template** (`assets/wizard_template.json`): встроенный шаблон конфига с переменными (`@log_level`, `@clash_api`, etc.), outbound-группами (proxy-out, auto-proxy-out, ru VPN) и selectable routing rules (Block Ads, Russian domains direct, BitTorrent direct, Games direct, Private IPs direct).
- **Settings Storage** (`lxbox_settings.json`): persistent хранилище через `path_provider` для user vars, proxy sources, enabled rules, last update timestamp.

### Added — Subscription & Settings UI (Feature 006)
- **Subscriptions Screen**: добавление подписок по URL или direct link, отображение списка с node count и статусом, swipe-to-delete, кнопки "Update All & Generate" и "Generate Config".
- **Settings Screen**: редактирование wizard vars (log level, Clash API, DNS strategy, etc.), вкл/выкл selectable routing rules, кнопка Apply с автоматической перегенерацией конфига.
- **Drawer Integration**: пункты Subscriptions и Settings в навигационном drawer главного экрана.

### Added — Config Editor (Feature 007)
- Pretty JSON display: конфиг в редакторе отображается с 2-space indentation. Сохранение в compact JSON для sing-box.

### Added — Ping & Node Management (Feature 008)
- **Mass Ping**: кнопка рядом с селектором группы запускает последовательный пинг всех нод. Иконка меняется на Stop — отмена в любой момент. Epoch-based guard против race condition.
- **Расширенное Long-press меню** на ноде: Ping, Use this node, Copy name.
- **Цветовая индикация задержки**: зелёный (<200ms), оранжевый (<500ms), красный (>500ms / ошибка).

### Added — Dark Theme & UX (Feature 009)
- **Dark Theme**: `ThemeMode.system` — автоматическое переключение по системным настройкам.
- **Node Sorting**: циклическое переключение Default → Latency ↑ → Latency ↓ → Name A→Z. Кнопка в заголовке Nodes.
- **Pull-to-refresh** на списке нод (RefreshIndicator → reloadProxies).
- **Node count** в заголовке Nodes.
- **Reload groups** перемещён в строку заголовка Nodes.
- **Long-press на заголовке Nodes** → быстрый переход в Settings.

### Added — Quick Start / Get Free VPN (Feature 010)
- **Get Free preset** (`assets/get_free.json`): встроенный пресет с двумя бесплатными подписками (@igareck) и рекомендованными правилами роутинга.
- **Quick Start card** на главном экране: появляется при отсутствии конфига и подписок. Один тап → загрузка пресета → fetch подписок → генерация конфига → готово к запуску.

### Added — Auto-refresh Subscriptions
- При нажатии Start проверяется `parser.reload` интервал (по умолчанию 12h). Если прошло достаточно времени — автоматическое обновление подписок и перегенерация конфига перед запуском VPN.
- Парсинг Go-style duration (`"12h"`, `"4h"`, `"30m"`).

### Added — Subscription Metadata
- Поля `name`, `lastUpdated`, `lastNodeCount` в ProxySource с persistent-сериализацией.
- Умный `displayName`: имя → hostname из URL → raw URL.
- Отображение "2h ago", "just now" в списке подписок.

### Added — Traffic Stats & Connection Info
- **Traffic bar** на главном экране: upload/download total, количество активных соединений, uptime (время с момента подключения).
- Heartbeat теперь запрашивает `/connections` вместо `/version` (двойное назначение: мониторинг + статистика).

### Added — Subscription Editing
- **Long-press** на подписке → bottom sheet: переименование и удаление.
- `renameAt()`, `moveEntry()` в SubscriptionController для управления порядком.

### Added — App Lifecycle
- `WidgetsBindingObserver` на HomeScreen: при возврате из фона немедленная проверка heartbeat для быстрого обнаружения revoke.

### Added — Config Export
- Кнопка Share в Config Editor → экспорт JSON через system share sheet (share_plus, XFile temp).
- Кнопка Share в Debug Screen → экспорт логов в .log файл.

### Added — Stop Confirmation
- Диалог подтверждения перед Stop VPN если > 3 активных соединений.

### Added — About Screen
- Версия, ссылки на репозиторий и sing-box, кредиты, tech stack.

### Improved — Empty States
- Контекстные placeholder-ы с иконками: нет конфига, нет нод в группе, VPN не запущен.

### Added — Local Rule Set Cache (Feature 011)
- **RuleSetDownloader**: при генерации конфига все remote `.srs` rule sets (ads, ru-domains и др.) скачиваются в `<app_dir>/rule_sets/` и подставляются как `"type": "local"` в конфиг. Повторная загрузка только по истечении `parser.reload` интервала.
- Ускорение первого запуска: sing-box не ждёт скачивания rule sets — всё уже на диске.
- Graceful fallback: при ошибке скачивания запись остаётся `"type": "remote"`.

### Changed — Preset Groups (replaces Outbound Constructor)
- **Outbound constructor удалён**: regex-фильтры, per-source outbound configs, skip rules — всё убрано.
- **Preset groups**: фиксированные группы `auto-proxy-out`, `proxy-out`, `vpn-1`, `vpn-2` определены в `wizard_template.json`.
- Все ноды подписок идут в каждую включённую группу — без фильтрации.
- **ProxySource упрощён**: удалены `skip`, `outbounds`, `tagMask`, `tagPostfix`, `excludeFromGlobal`.
- **Settings**: новая секция «Proxy Groups» для включения/отключения пресетных групп.
- Чистое сокращение: -139 строк кода.

### Changed — Spec Structure
- Миграция `docs/spec/tasks/` в `docs/spec/features/` (tasks.md внутри каждой фичи).
- Удалена отдельная папка задач.
